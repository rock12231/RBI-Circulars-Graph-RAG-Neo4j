                "content": "The Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7, 2019, read with the Framework for Compromise Settlements and Technical Write-offs dated June 08, 2023, provides a principle-based resolution framework to the regulated entities (REs) for addressing any stress in borrower accounts. Further, specific frameworks have been provided for REs to restructure exposures affected by natural calamities viz. the Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural Calamities) Directions, 2018-SCBs dated October 17, 2018; Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural Calamities) Directions 2018 – RRBs dated October 17, 2018; Guidelines for Relief Measures by NBFCs in areas affected by Natural Calamities dated July 28, 2016; and Master Circular - Management of Advances – UCBs dated July 25, 2023.\n\n2. Some of the REs may also be involved in implementation of various forms of Debt Relief Schemes (DRS) announced by State Governments that inter alia entail sacrifice/waiver of debt obligations of a targeted segment of borrowers, against fiscal support. If such schemes are announced frequently, incommensurately, or without due consideration to the principles of financial discipline, they would negatively affect credit discipline and in the long run, may be counter-productive to the credit flow to such borrowers. Apart from the broader implications for the credit discipline and moral hazard issues, DRS also raises certain prudential concerns, which include delay in receipt of dues; mismatch between the claims admitted / submitted by the REs and accepted by the concerned Government as per the terms of the scheme; mandatory requirement of fresh credit by the REs, etc.\n\n3. As such, the REs participating as lenders under such DRS shall comply with the guidelines contained in Annex-1, that lay down certain broad principles in this regard. The guidelines shall apply in respect of DRS notified on or after the date of issue of this guideline and shall be without prejudice to the extant guidelines on resolution of stressed assets applicable to the respective REs.\n\n4. In this context, a model operating procedure (MOP) has also been shared with the State Governments (Annex-2) for their consideration while designing and implementing such DRS through a consultative approach, to avoid any non-alignment of expectations of the stakeholders involved, including the Government, lenders, borrowers, etc.\n\n5. In respect of relief measures announced prior to the introduction of these guidelines, any dues pending receipt from Government, for more than 90 days shall attract specific provision of 100%. REs shall take necessary action and actively follow up with the respective Governments for settlement of such dues at the earliest.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Vaibhav Chaturvedi)    Chief General Manager"

Announcement / notification of any such DRS should include the specific stress or distress situation necessitating announcement of such support. Given the broader implications of such DRS for the credit culture, while broad based relief measures can be addressed through pure fiscal support in the form of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), DRS should be considered only as a measure of last resort when other measures to alleviate financial stress have failed."

                "content": "A reference is invited to RBI circular DOR.SOG (LEG).REC/64/09.08.024/2023-24 dated January 1, 2024 on the captioned subject. It requires banks, among other things, to undertake an annual review of accounts/ deposits where there are no customer induced transactions for more than a year; segregation in their Core Banking Solution of accounts opened for credit of scholarship amount and/ or Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)/ Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) under Government Schemes to facilitate credit of DBTs even if such accounts have become inoperative; and take steps to trace the customers of these accounts/ deposits. It also contains operational guidelines for activation of such accounts/ deposits, customer awareness measures such as public awareness and financial literacy campaigns to be undertaken by banks and requires information on the process for activation of such accounts/ deposits to be displayed on the banks’ websites and branches.\n\n2. The Department of Supervision, RBI, recently conducted an analysis, which revealed that the number of inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits in several banks was on the higher side vis-a-vis their total deposits as well as in absolute terms. The reasons were attributed to either inactivity for a long time or pending updation/ periodic updation of KYC in such accounts. Reportedly, there were instances of customers facing inconvenience when they approached the bank branches for activation of inoperative accounts including inadvertent errors in customer details such as mismatch in name, etc. It was also observed that a few banks have a large pendency of accounts that are due for updation/ periodic updation of KYC, resulting in such accounts getting frozen for further transactions as per bank’s internal policies.\n\n3. The banks are, therefore, advised to take necessary steps urgently to bring down the number of inoperative/ frozen accounts and make the process of activation of such accounts smoother and hassle free, including by enabling seamless updation of KYC through mobile/internet banking, non-home branches, Video Customer Identification Process, etc. While the accounts of beneficiaries of various Central/ State government schemes like DBT/EBT etc., are required to be segregated to facilitate uninterrupted credit of such DBT/EBT amounts in their accounts, instances have been observed where the accounts of such beneficiaries have been frozen due to other factors such as pending updation/ periodic updation of KYC. Since these accounts mostly pertain to the people from the underprivileged sections of the society, the banks may facilitate the process of activation of accounts by taking an empathetic view in such cases. The banks may also organise special campaigns for facilitating activation of inoperative/ frozen accounts. Besides, the banks may also facilitate Aadhaar updation for customers through the branches providing Aadhaar related services. Instructions have been issued separately to SLBCs to proactively monitor the situation in their respective jurisdictions with a view to minimise customer inconvenience.\n\n4. The progress in reduction of inoperative/ frozen accounts and the special efforts made by the banks in this regard, may be monitored by the Customer Service Committee (CSC) of the Board. In addition, the banks are also advised to report the same on a quarterly basis to the respective Senior Supervisory Manager (SSM) through DAKSH portal, starting from the quarter ending December 31, 2024.\n\n5. A copy of this Circular shall also be placed before the CSC of the Board in its next meeting along with a monitorable action plan for ensuring full compliance in this regard.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Tarun Singh)    Chief General Manager"

In case the contravener fails to submit the additional information/documents called for within the specified period, the application for compounding shall be liable to be returned.\n\n5.3 The following factors, which are only indicative, shall be taken into consideration for the purpose of passing compounding order and determining amount on payment of which contravention shall be compounded:\n\n5.4 As per provisions under section 13 of FEMA,1999, the compounding amount can be up to three times the sum involved in the contravention. The compounding amount payable is calculated based on guidance note given below. It may, however, be noted that the guidance note is meant only for the purpose of broadly indicating the basis on which the compounding amount is derived by the compounding authorities in the Reserve Bank.

In case of paragraph 8 of Schedule I to FEMA 20/2000 RB contraventions, the compounding amount payable will be further graded as under:\n\niv. In cases where it is established that the contravener has made undue gains, the amount thereof may be neutralized to a reasonable extent by adding the same to the compounding amount calculated as per matrix above.\n\nv.

                "content": "A reference is invited to the circulars1 issued by the Reserve Bank containing various prudential guidelines related to loans against pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery for different categories of Supervised Entities (SEs).\n\n2. Reserve Bank has recently carried out a review of the adherence to prudential guidelines as well as practices being followed by SEs with regard to loans against pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery. The review, as well as the findings of the onsite examination of select SEs by the Reserve Bank, indicate several irregular practices in this activity. The major deficiencies include (i) shortcomings in use of third parties for sourcing and appraisal of loans; (ii) valuation of gold without the presence of the customer; (iii) inadequate due diligence and lack of end use monitoring of gold loans; (iv) lack of transparency during auction of gold ornaments and jewellery on default by the customer; (v) weaknesses in monitoring of LTV; and (vi) incorrect application of risk-weights, etc. The enclosed Annex incorporates further details in this regard.\n\n3. All SEs are, therefore, advised to comprehensively review their policies, processes and practices on gold loans to identify gaps, including those highlighted in this advice, and initiate appropriate remedial measures in a timebound manner. Further, the gold loan portfolio should be closely monitored, especially in the light of significant growth in the portfolio in certain SEs. It should also be ensured that adequate controls are in place over outsourced activities and third-party service providers.\n\n4. Action taken with regard to the above may be informed to the Senior Supervisory Manager (SSM) of Reserve Bank within three months of the date of this circular. Non-compliance with regulatory guidelines in this regard will be viewed seriously and will attract, among other things, supervisory action by RBI.\n\n5. This circular takes immediate effect.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Tarun Singh)      Chief General Manager\n\nEncl.: As above"

The Directions envisaged the Non-Banking Financial Company – Peer to Peer Lending Platform (NBFC-P2P Lending Platform) to act as an intermediary providing online marketplace / platform to the participants involved in peer to peer lending. Accordingly, the Directions had laid down clear guidelines regarding various aspects of functioning of NBFC-P2P Lending Platforms. However, it has been observed that some of these platforms have adopted certain practices which are violative of the said Directions. Such practices include, among others, violation of the prescribed funds transfer mechanism, promoting peer to peer lending as an investment product with features like tenure linked assured minimum returns, providing liquidity options and at times acting like deposit takers and lenders instead of being a platform. Such violations, when observed, have been dealt with bilaterally by the Reserve Bank of India for remediation.\n\n3. In view of the above, it has been decided to elaborate and clarify certain provisions with some modifications for proper implementation of the Directions. The amended provisions of the Directions are enclosed in the Annex to this circular.\n\n4. The amended provisions contained in this circular except item I(f)(ii) of the enclosed Annex shall come into effect immediately. Item I(f)(ii) of the Annex shall be effective from ninety days of the date of this circular.\n\n5. The Master Direction – Non-Banking Financial Company – Peer to Peer Lending Platform (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2017 stands modified accordingly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(J.P.

In terms of para 4 of the above circular, it was advised that further harmonisation of regulations applicable to HFCs and NBFCs will be taken up in a phased manner over the next two years to ensure that the transition is achieved with least disruption.\n\n2. Since the transfer of regulation of HFCs from National Housing Bank (NHB) to Reserve Bank with effect from August 09, 2019, various regulations have been issued treating HFCs as a category of NBFCs. To be consistent with this policy stance and as stated in para 4 of the aforementioned circular, an analysis of regulations applicable to HFCs and NBFCs was undertaken, with an objective of harmonising these regulations, duly considering specialised nature of the HFCs.\n\n3. Accordingly, based on a review of the extant regulations applicable to HFCs prescribed vide Master Direction – Non-Banking Financial Company – Housing Finance Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2021, it has been decided to issue revised regulations as detailed in the Part A of Annex. As part of the exercise, certain regulations applicable to NBFCs have also been reviewed and revised regulations are detailed in Part B of Annex.

Considering the faster turnaround time in credit underwriting through digital processes, it is imperative that the Credit Information Reports (CIRs) provided by CICs reflect a more current information, enabling lenders to make informed credit decisions.\n\n2. Accordingly, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 11 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 (CICRA, 2005), it is directed that CICs and CIs shall keep the credit information collected/maintained by them updated regularly on a fortnightly basis (i.e., as on 15th and last day of the respective month) or at such shorter intervals as mutually agreed upon between the CI and the CIC. The fortnightly submission of credit information by CIs to CICs shall be ensured within seven (7) calendar days of the relevant reporting fortnight. Further, as directed vide circular DoR.FIN.REC.49/20.16.003/2023-24 dated October 26, 2023, CICs are required to ingest credit information data received from the CIs, as per their data acceptance rules, within seven (7) calendar days of its receipt from the CIs. This is now being revised to five (5) calendar days of its receipt.\n\n3. CICs shall provide a list of CIs which are not adhering to the fortnightly data submission timelines to Department of Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office at half yearly intervals (as on March 31 and September 30 each year) for information and monitoring purposes.\n\n4. These instructions shall be effective from January 1, 2025. However, the CIs and CICs are encouraged to give effect to these instructions as expeditiously as feasible but not later than January 1, 2025.\n\n5. CICs and CIs that contravene or default in adherence to the above directions shall be liable for penal action as per the provisions of CICRA, 2005.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(J. P.

                "content": "Please refer to our circular FIDD.CO.FSD.BC.No.13/05.02.001/2022-23 dated November 23, 2022 conveying the decision of the Government of India for continuation of the Modified Interest Subvention Scheme for short term loans for agriculture and allied activities for the years 2022-23 and 2023-24.\n\n2. In this regard, it is advised that Government of India has approved the continuation of the Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS) for the financial year 2024-25 with the following stipulations:\n\n(i) In order to provide short term crop loans and short term loans for allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. upto an overall limit of ₹3 lakh to farmers through KCC at concessional interest rate during the year 2024-25, it has been decided to provide interest subvention to lending institutions viz. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and Private Sector Banks (in respect of loans given by their rural and semi-urban branches only), Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and computerized Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) ceded with Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), on use of their own resources. This interest subvention will be calculated on the loan amount from the date of disbursement/drawal up to the date of actual repayment of the loan by the farmer or up to the due date of the loan fixed by the banks, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year. The applicable lending rate to farmers and the rate of interest subvention for the financial year 2024-25 will be as follows:\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\n(ii) An additional interest subvention of 3% per annum will be provided to such of those farmers repaying in time, i.e., from the date of disbursement of the loan/s upto the actual date of repayment or upto the due date fixed by the banks for repayment of such loan/s, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year from the date of disbursement. This also implies that the farmers repaying promptly as above would get short term crop loans and/or short term loans for allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. @ 4% per annum during the financial year 2024-25. This benefit would not accrue to those farmers who repay their agri loans after one year of availing such loans.\n\n(iii) Interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits on short term crop loans and short term loans for allied activities will be available on an overall limit of ₹3 lakh per annum subject to a maximum sub-limit of ₹2 lakh per farmer in respect of those farmers involved only in activities related to animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. The limit for crop loan component will take priority for interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits and the residual amount will be considered towards allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. subject to the cap as mentioned above. (Illustrations)\n\n(iv) In order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store their produce in warehouses, the benefit of interest subvention under KCC will be available to small and marginal farmers for a further period of upto six months post the harvest of the crop against negotiable warehouse receipts on the produce stored in warehouses accredited with Warehousing Development Regulatory Authority (WDRA), at the same rate as applicable to the crop loan.\n\n(v) To provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, the applicable rate of interest subvention for that year will be made available to banks for the first year on the restructured loan amount. Such restructured loans will attract normal rate of interest from the second year onwards.\n\n(vi) However, to provide relief to farmers affected due to severe natural calamities, the applicable rate of interest subvention for that year will be made available to banks for first three years/entire period (subject to a maximum of five years) on the restructured loan amount. Further, in all such cases, the benefit of prompt repayment incentive @3% per annum shall also be provided to the affected farmers. The grant of such benefit in cases of severe natural calamities shall, however, be decided by a High Level Committee (HLC) based on the recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) and Sub Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC).\n\n(vii) To ensure hassle-free benefits to farmers under the MISS, Aadhar linkage would continue to be mandatory for availing the above-mentioned short-term loans in 2024-25.\n\n3. Banks are advised to capture the requisite category wise granular data of individual farmer beneficiaries under the scheme and report the same on Kisan Rin Portal (KRP) to settle the audited MISS claims for the year 2024-25.\n\n4. The claims in respect of computerized PACS ceded with SCBs may be uploaded separately by the respective banks, with the certification that interest subvention/prompt repayment incentive is being claimed on loans for which no refinance has been availed from NABARD, duly certified by the banks’ Statutory Auditors, through KRP module.\n\n5. Banks are advised to take necessary action to upload the claims/additional claims duly certified by their Statutory Auditors as true and correct, on KRP module for FY 2024-25 latest by June 30, 2025.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(R. Giridharan)      Chief General Manager"

                "content": "As you are aware, under the provisions of the respective State Co-operative Societies Acts, or otherwise, on prudential consideration, several co-operative banks have created Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR)1. While in some cases, BDDR is created by recognising an expense in the Profit and Loss (P&L) Account, in other cases it is created through appropriations from net profits.\n\n2. In terms of Accounting Standard (AS) 52, all expenses which are recognised in a period should be included in the determination of net profit or loss for the period. Consequently, not recognising the required provisions for Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) as an expense while arriving at the net profit in the P&L Account is not in consonance with extant Accounting Standards. Further, the treatment of BDDR for regulatory capital and reckoning of net NPAs varies across banks and in many cases has been observed to be at variance with regulatory norms.\n\n3. Accordingly, with a view to bringing about uniformity in the treatment of BDDR for prudential purposes, revised instructions on BDDR are being issued, as under:\n\na) With effect from the FY 2024-25, all provisions as per Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) norms3, whether accounted for under the head “BDDR” or any other head of account, shall be charged as an expense to the P&L account in the accounting period in which they are recognised. The eligibility of such provisions for regulatory capital purposes shall continue to be as defined in the extant guidelines on capital adequacy4.\n\nb) After charging all applicable provisions as per IRACP norms and other extant regulations to the P&L Account, banks may make any appropriations of net profits below the line to BDDR, if required as per the applicable statutes or otherwise.\n\nc) As a one-time measure, with a view to facilitate rectification and smoother transition to an AS compliant approach, the following regulatory treatment is prescribed:\n\n4. Banks should comply with the provisions of the respective State Co-operative Societies Acts / Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002 as applicable."

It is observed that some UCBs have created the Dividend Equalisation Fund (DEF) through appropriation of profits, with an intent to utilise these balances to pay dividend in future years, when profits are not sufficient or where the bank has posted a net loss. However, extant guidelines on “Declaration of Dividends by UCBs” dated July 05, 2012 ibid prohibit dividend payments from previously accumulated profits or reserves and mandate that dividend can only be paid by the banks from net profit of the current year after making all statutory and other provisions and after adjustment for accumulated losses in full. It is also observed that UCBs have been considering the balances in DEF as part of Tier-II capital.\n\n3. In order to provide a better treatment of these balances for regulatory capital purposes, it has been decided, as a onetime measure, to permit UCBs to transfer the balances in the DEF to general reserves/free reserves. The credit balances in general reserves/free reserves, shall qualify as Tier-I capital as per our Master Circular ibid.\n\n4. Suitable disclosures shall be made of such transfers in the ‘Notes on Accounts’ to the Balance Sheet in terms of Reserve Bank of India (Financial Statements - Presentation and Disclosures) Directions, 2021 dated August 30, 2021.\n\n5.

Whereas in IFSCs, an unlisted Indian entity also may make such OPI in units or any other instrument (by whatever name called) issued by an investment fund or vehicle, in terms of schedule V of the OI Rules subject to limits, as applicable.\n\nExplanation: ‘investment fund overseas, duly regulated’ for the purpose of this para shall also include funds whose activities are regulated by financial sector regulator of host country or jurisdiction through a fund manager.”\n\n(b) Existing Paragraph 24(1) of FEM (OI) Directions, 2022 is replaced with the following:\n\n“A person resident in India, being an Indian entity or a resident individual, may make investment (including sponsor contribution) in units or any other instrument (by whatever name called) issued by an investment fund or vehicle set up in an IFSC, as OPI. Accordingly, in addition to listed Indian companies and resident individuals, unlisted Indian entities also may make such investment in IFSC.”\n\n3. Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investments) Directions, 2022 issued vide A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No.12 dated August 22, 2022, shall accordingly be updated to reflect the above changes. AD Category-I Banks may bring the contents of this circular to the notice of their constituents.\n\n4.

                "content": "1.1 Operational Risk is inherent in all banking/ financial products, services, activities, processes, and systems. Effective management of Operational Risk is an integral part of the Regulated Entities’ (REs) risk management framework. Sound Management of Operational Risk shows the overall effectiveness of the Board of Directors and Senior Management in administering the RE’s portfolio of products, services, activities, processes, and systems.\n\n1.2 An operational disruption can threaten the viability of an RE, impact its customers and other market participants, and ultimately have an impact on financial stability. It can result from man-made causes, Information Technology (IT) threats (e.g., cyber-attacks, changes in technology, technology failures, etc), geopolitical conflicts, business disruptions, internal/external frauds, execution/ delivery errors, third party dependencies, or natural causes (e.g., climate change, pandemic, etc.).\n\n1.3 An RE needs to factor in the entire gamut of risks (including the aforesaid risks in its risk assessment policies/ processes), identify and assess them using appropriate tools, monitor its material operational exposures and devise appropriate risk mitigation/management strategies using strong internal controls to minimize operational disruptions and continue to deliver critical operations, thus ensuring operational resilience.\n\n1.4 Until recently, the predominant Operational Risks that REs faced emanated from vulnerabilities related to increasing dependence and rapid adoption of technology for provision of financial services and intermediation. However, the financial sector’s growing reliance on third-party providers (including technology service providers) exacerbated by Covid-19 pandemic with greater reliance on virtual working arrangements, has highlighted the increasing importance of Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience; which not only benefits the RE by strengthening its ability to remain a viable going concern but also supports the financial system by ensuring continuous delivery of critical operations during any disruption.\n\n1.5 In view of the foregoing, the Reserve Bank, through this Guidance Note on Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience (hereafter ‘Guidance Note’) intends to:\n\n1.5.1 promote and further improve the effectiveness of Operational Risk Management of the REs, and\n\n1.5.2 enhance their Operational Resilience given the interconnections and interdependencies, within the financial system, that result from the complex and dynamic environment in which the REs operate.\n\n1.6 This Guidance Note updates the “Guidance Note on Management of Operational Risk” dated October 14, 2005. It has been prepared based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) principles documents issued in March 2021, viz., (a) ‘Revisions to the Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk’ and (b) ‘Principles for Operational Resilience’ as well as the some of the international best practices.\n\n1.7 The Guidance Note has adopted a principle-based and proportionate approach to ensure smooth implementation across REs of various sizes, nature, complexity, geographic location and risk profile of their businesses. Although the exact approach may vary from RE to RE, the Guidance Note provides an overarching guidance to REs for improving and further strengthening their Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF). It gives adequate flexibility to REs for Operational Risk Management to enhance their ability to withstand, adapt and recover from potential operational disruptions and ensure their Operational Resilience. The systems, procedures and tools prescribed in this Guidance Note are indicative in nature and should be read in conjunction with the relevant instructions issued by Reserve Bank from time to time. In case of inconsistency, if any, the relevant instructions issued by the Reserve Bank would prevail.\n\n1.8 The operational risk regulatory capital requirements shall continue to be guided by the applicable guidelines1."

                "content": "1.1.1 The global financial crisis greatly impacted financial stability around the world. Given the fact that the effects of crisis were much more severe than all the scenarios envisaged by banks as part of their stress tests, several structural changes were undertaken to strengthen banks’/financial institutions’ financial resilience. Though capital and liquidity requirements have improved the ability of banks to absorb shocks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) was of the view that more work needs to be done in the area of Operational Risk Management to provide additional safeguards to the financial system.\n\n1.1.2 The BCBS recognized Operational Risk as a distinct class of risk in 2001, outside of credit and market risks and came out with Sound Practices for Management and Supervision of Operational Risk in 2003. Subsequently, these principles were revised in 2011, to incorporate the lessons learnt from the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09. In 2014, a review of the implementation of these Principles was carried out to assess the extent to which banks had implemented these Principles, identify significant gaps, if any, in their implementation and highlight emerging and noteworthy Operational Risk Management practices at banks which may be included in the Principles. It was also observed that several Principles have not yet been adequately implemented, and there was a need for further guidance to facilitate their implementation in areas such as risk identification and assessment tools, key risk indicators, business process mapping, monitoring of action plans, change management programmes and processes, implementation of the three lines of defence, oversight by Board of Directors and Senior Management, articulation of Operational Risk appetite and tolerance statements, risk disclosures, etc. BCBS also recognised that the 2011 Principles did not adequately capture certain important sources of Operational Risk, such as those arising from Information and Communication Technology (ICT) risk.\n\n1.1.3 Subsequently, the onset of Covid-19 pandemic created disruptions affecting information systems, personnel, facilities, relationships with third-party service providers and customers. It altered the way banks operated in view of their increased demands on technology given the greater reliance on virtual working arrangements. In addition, incidents of cyber threats (ransomware attacks, phishing, etc.) spiked, and the likelihood for materialising of the Operational Risk events caused by people, failed processes, and systems increased, which tested the operational resilience of banks.\n\n1.1.4 In light of the same, BCBS felt that further work was necessary to strengthen banks’ ability to withstand Operational Risk related events such as pandemics, cyber incidents, technology failures and natural disasters which could cause significant operational failures or widespread disruptions in financial markets. It is in this backdrop, that BCBS came out with updated ‘Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk’ in 2021. Additionally, it also came out with ‘Principles on Operational Resilience’ to enhance the ability of banks to withstand, adapt to and recover from potential hazards."

                "content": "1.2.1 Operational Risk is a complex risk category, when it comes to identification, quantification and mitigation of risk. It is impacted by numerous factors such as internal business processes, regulatory landscape, business growth, customer preferences, and even factors external to the organization. It is highly dynamic in nature where new and emerging forces such as breakthrough technologies, data availability, new business models, interaction with third parties, etc., continuously create new demands on Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF).\n\n1.2.2 While Operational Risk Management allows an RE to better identify, assess and mitigate the Operational Risks, Operational Resilience provides it the ability to deliver critical functions in the event of any disruption. Although Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience address different goals, they are closely interconnected. An effective Operational Risk Management system and a robust level of Operational Resilience work together to reduce the frequency and the impact of Operational Risk events. In view of the above, Reserve Bank, through this Guidance Note intends to promote Operational Risk Management and enhance the Operational Resilience of REs.\n\n1.2.3 This Guidance Note on Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience has been built on three pillars. The three pillars are:\n\n1.2.4 These three pillars support a holistic approach to the management of Operational Risk and Operational Resilience and create a feedback loop that fosters perpetual embedding of lessons learned into an RE’s preparation for operational disruptions and its performance during actual occurrence of disruptions."

It does not include Risk Management and Internal Audit functions unless otherwise specifically indicated.\n\n2.2 “Critical operations” refers to critical functions3, activities, processes, services and their relevant supporting assets4 the disruption of which would be material to the continued operation of the RE or its role in the financial system. Whether a particular operation is “critical” depends on the nature of the RE and its role in the financial system. REs’ tolerance for disruption should be applied at the critical operations level.\n\n2.3 “Event management” is the process of identification, analysis, end-to-end management and reporting of an operational risk event that follows a pre-determined set of protocols.\n\n2.4 “Incidents” are current or past disruptive events the occurrence of which would have an adverse effect on critical operations of the RE. Incident management is the process of identifying, analysing, rectifying and learning from an incident (including a cyber incident) and preventing recurrences or mitigating the severity thereof. The goal of incident management is to limit the disruption and restore critical operations in line with the RE’s risk tolerance for disruption.\n\n2.5 “Information and Communication Technology”5 refers to the underlying physical and logical design of information technology and communication systems, the individual hardware and software components, data, and the operating environment.\n\n2.6 “Mapping”  is the process of identifying, documenting, and understanding the chain of activities involved in delivering critical operations. It incorporates the identification of all interdependencies and interconnections including people, processes, technology and third parties.\n\n2.7 “Operational resilience” means the ability of an RE to deliver critical operations through disruption. This ability enables an RE to identify and protect itself from threats and potential failures, respond and adapt to, as well as recover and learn from disruptive events to minimise their impact on the delivery of critical operations through disruption. In considering its operational resilience, an RE should assume that disruptions will occur, and take into account its overall risk appetite and tolerance for disruption or impact tolerance.\n\n2.8 “Operational Risk” means the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. It includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk and it is inherent in all banking/ financial products, activities, processes and systems.\n\n2.9 “Operational Risk Management” Operational Risk Management refers to entire gamut of activities right from risk identification, measurement and assessment, monitoring and control, mitigation, reporting to senior management and the Board of Directors on the RE’s risk exposures, Business Continuity Management, and learning through feedback for improvement.\n\n2.10 “Operational Risk profiles” describe the Operational Risk exposures and control environment assessments of business units of REs and it considers the range of potential impacts that could arise from estimates of expected to plausible severe losses.\n\n2.11 “Regulated Entities” (REs) refers to the entities mentioned below:\n\n2.11.1 All Commercial Banks6;\n\n2.11.2 All Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks/State Co-operative Banks/Central Co-operative Banks;\n\n2.11.3 All All-India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) (viz., Exim Bank, NABARD, NHB, SIDBI, and NaBFID); and\n\n2.11.4 All Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) including Housing Finance Companies.\n\n2.12 “Respective functions” refers to the appropriate function(s) within the RE’s three lines of defence, which are (i) business unit management; (ii) an independent Operational Risk Management including Compliance function; and (iii) audit function.\n\n2.13 “Risk appetite” is the aggregate level and types of risk an RE is willing to assume, decided in advance and within its risk capacity, to achieve its strategic objectives and business plan.7\n\n2.14 “Risk tolerance” is the variation around the prescribed risk appetite that the RE is willing to tolerate.\n\n2.15 “Supervisory Authority” means,\n\n2.15.1 Reserve Bank of India in case of Commercial Banks (including Local Area Banks, Payments Banks, Small Finance Banks, and Primary Urban Co-operative Banks), Non-Banking Financial Companies, and All India Financial Institutions.\n\n2.15.2 National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development (NABARD) in case of State Co-operative Banks, Central Co-operative Banks, and Regional Rural Banks.\n\n2.15.3 National Housing Bank (NHB) in case of Housing Finance Companies.\n\n2.16 “Tolerance for disruption or Impact Tolerance” is the level of disruption from any type of Operational Risk an RE is willing to accept given a range of severe but plausible scenarios."

The actions of the Board of Directors and Senior Management as well as the RE’s risk management policies, processes and systems provide the foundation for a sound risk management culture.\n\n4.2 The Board of Directors should establish a code of conduct or an ethics policy to address conduct risk. This code or policy should be applicable to both staff and Board members. It should set clear expectations for integrity and ethical values of the highest standard, identify acceptable business practices, and prohibit conflicts of interest or the inappropriate provision of financial services (whether wilful or negligent). It should be regularly reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors and attested by employees. Its implementation should be overseen by a senior ethics committee, or another Board-level committee, and should be publicly available (e.g., on the RE’s website, branch premises). A separate code of conduct may be established for specific positions in the RE (e.g., treasury dealers etc.).\n\n4.3 Senior Management should set clear expectations and define accountabilities to ensure RE’s staff understand their roles and responsibilities of risk management, as well as their authority to act.\n\n4.4 Compensation policies should be aligned to the RE’s statement of risk appetite and tolerance as well as overall soundness of risk management framework, and appropriately balance risk and reward. Inappropriate incentives may result in increased litigation, reputational risk, or other risks to the RE. Therefore, the RE should review whether its existing governance and controls are adequate in light of risks arising from incentive arrangements.\n\n4.5 Senior Management should ensure that an appropriate level of Operational Risk training is available at all levels throughout the organisation, such as heads of business units, heads of internal controls and senior managers. Training provided should reflect the seniority, role and responsibilities of the individuals for whom it is intended. It should also appropriately include ethics training.\n\n4.6 Strong and consistent support of the Board of Directors and Senior Management for operational risk management coupled with ethical behaviour convincingly reinforces codes of conduct and ethics, compensation strategies, etc.\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\n4.7 The Board of Directors and Senior Management of RE should understand the nature and complexity of the risks inherent in the portfolio of RE’s new business initiatives, products, services, activities, processes, and systems, which is a fundamental premise of sound risk management. This is particularly important for Operational Risk, as it is inherent in all business products, services, activities, processes, and systems.\n\n4.8 The components of the ORMF should be fully integrated into the overall risk management processes of the RE by the first line of defence, adequately challenged and reviewed by the second line of defence, and independently reviewed by the third line of defence. The ORMF should be embedded across all levels of the RE including group and business units as well as new business initiatives, products, services, activities, processes, and systems. In addition, results of the RE’s Operational Risk assessment should be incorporated into the RE’s overall business strategy development process. The overall approach to ORMF should reflect the following:\n\n4.8.1 Management of Operational Risk is embedded within business lines of an RE.\n\n4.8.2 Senior managers are responsible for management and ownership of Operational Risk across RE’s end-to-end processes.\n\n4.8.3 Board is ultimately responsible and accountable for oversight of Operational Risk Management.\n\n4.9 The ORMF should be comprehensively and appropriately documented in Board of Directors approved policies and include definitions of Operational Risk and operational loss. If REs do not adequately describe and classify Operational Risk and loss exposure, it would result in significantly reducing the effectiveness of their ORMF.\n\n4.10 ORMF documentation should clearly:\n\n4.10.1 identify the governance structures used to manage Operational Risk, including reporting lines and accountabilities, and the mandates and membership of the Operational Risk governance committees;\n\n4.10.2 reference the relevant Operational Risk Management policies and procedures;\n\n4.10.3 describe the tools for risk and control identification and assessment and the role and responsibilities of the three lines of defence in using them;\n\n4.10.4 describe the RE’s accepted Operational Risk appetite and tolerance; the thresholds, material activity triggers or limits for inherent and residual risk; and the approved risk mitigation strategies and instruments;\n\n4.10.5 describe the RE’s approach to ensure controls are designed, implemented and operate effectively;\n\n4.10.6 describe the RE’s approach to establishing and monitoring thresholds or limits for inherent and residual risk exposure;\n\n4.10.7 describe inventory risks and controls implemented by all business units (e.g., in a control library);\n\n4.10.8 establish risk reporting and management information systems (MIS) for producing timely, and accurate data;\n\n4.10.9 provide for a common taxonomy of Operational Risk terms to ensure consistency of risk identification, exposure rating and risk management objectives across all business units. The taxonomy can distinguish Operational Risk exposures by event types, causes, materiality and business units where they occur; it can also flag those operational risk exposures that partially or entirely represent legal, conduct, model and ICT (including cyber) risks as well as exposures in the credit or market risk boundary;\n\n4.10.10 provide for appropriate independent review and challenge of the outcomes of the risk management process; and\n\n4.10.11 require the policies to be reviewed and revised as appropriate based on continued assessment of the quality of the control environment addressing internal and external environmental changes or whenever a material change in the Operational Risk profile of the RE occurs."

The Board of Directors should establish clear lines of management responsibility and accountability for implementing a strong control environment. Controls should be regularly reviewed, monitored, and tested to ensure its ongoing effectiveness. The control environment should provide appropriate independence/separation of duties between Operational Risk Management functions, business units and support functions.\n\n5.3 The Board of Directors should review and approve the RE’s Operational Resilience approach considering the RE’s risk appetite and tolerance for disruption to its critical operations. In formulating the RE’s tolerance for disruption, the Board of Directors should consider its operational capabilities given a broad range of severe but plausible scenarios that would affect its critical operations. The Board of Directors should ensure that the RE’s policies effectively address instances where the RE’s capabilities are insufficient to meet its stated tolerance for disruption.\n\n5.4 The Board of Directors should take an active role in establishing a broad understanding of the RE’s operational resilience approach, through clear communication of its objectives to all relevant parties, including the RE’s personnel, third parties, and intragroup entities.\n\n5.5 Under the oversight of the Board of Directors, Senior Management should implement the RE’s operational resilience approach and ensure that financial, technical, and other resources are appropriately allocated in order to support the RE’s overall operational resilience approach.\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\n5.6 The risk appetite and tolerance statement for Operational Risk should be developed under the authority of the Board of Directors and linked to the RE’s short and long-term strategic and financial plans. Taking into account the interests of the RE’s customers and stakeholders as well as regulatory requirements, an effective risk appetite and tolerance statement should:\n\n5.6.1 be easy to communicate and easy to understand for all stakeholders;\n\n5.6.2 include key background information and assumptions that informed the RE’s business plans at the time of its approval;\n\n5.6.3 include statements that clearly articulate the motivation(s) for taking on or avoiding certain types of risk, and establish boundaries or indicators (which may be quantitative or not) to enable monitoring of these risks;\n\n5.6.4 ensure that the strategy and risk limits of business units and legal entities, as relevant, align with the RE-wide risk appetite statement; and\n\n5.6.5 be forward-looking and, where applicable, subject to scenario and stress testing to ensure that the RE understands what events might push it outside its risk appetite and tolerance statement.\n\n5.7 The starting point for an RE in enhancing its operational resilience is to set the criteria for defining its critical operations. The Board of Directors should approve clearly defined and documented criteria to determine how operations are classified as critical. The criteria should enable an RE to identify its critical operations and prioritise them in the event of a disruption. This should be achieved by considering the risk a disruption poses to its customers, the RE’s viability, safety and soundness, and overall financial stability. The criteria for the identification of critical operations should be reviewed and approved by the Board annually or at the time of implementing material changes to the business that would involve additional critical operations.\n\n5.8 The Board of Directors should review and approve impact tolerances for each critical operation at least annually or as and when a disruption occurs. The purpose of impact tolerance is to quantify the maximum acceptable level of disruption for each critical operation. It needs to be tested against severe but plausible scenarios to determine their appropriateness, i.e., to determine whether the RE is able to stay within the defined impact tolerances during a disruption.\n\n5.9 An RE should set at least one impact tolerance metric for each of its critical operations. At a minimum, there should be a (a) time-based metric (e.g., maximum acceptable duration a critical operation can withstand a disruption), (b) quantity-based metric (e.g., maximum extent of data loss that an RE would accept as a result of disruption) and (c) service level metric (e.g., minimum level of service that an RE would maintain while operating under alternative arrangements.) To further enhance its operational resilience, an RE should consider having additional impact tolerance metrics such as the maximum tolerable number of customers affected by a disruption; maximum number of transactions affected by a disruption; and the maximum value of transactions impacted.\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\n5.10 Senior Management should translate the ORMF approved by the Board of Directors into specific policies and procedures that can be implemented and verified within the different business units. It should clearly assign authority, responsibility and reporting relationships to encourage and maintain accountability, and to ensure the necessary resources are available to manage Operational Risk in line with the RE’s risk appetite and tolerance statement. Moreover, it should also ensure that the management oversight process is appropriate for the risks inherent in a business unit’s activity.\n\n5.11 Senior Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining robust challenge mechanisms and effective issue resolution processes. These should include systems to report, track, and when necessary, escalate issues to ensure resolution. REs should be able to demonstrate that the three-lines-of-defence approach is operating satisfactorily and to explain how the Board of Directors, independent Audit Committee of the Board, and Senior Management ensure that this approach is implemented and operating in an appropriate manner.\n\n5.12 Senior Management should ensure that staff responsible for managing Operational Risk co-ordinate and communicate effectively with staff responsible for managing credit, market, and other risks, as well as with those in the RE who are responsible for the procurement of external services such as insurance risk transfer and other third-party arrangements. Failure to do so could result in significant gaps or overlaps in an RE’s overall risk management programme.\n\n5.13 The managers of the OORF within the RE should be of sufficient stature to perform their duties effectively, ideally evidenced by a title that is commensurate with other risk management functions such as credit, market and liquidity risk.\n\n5.14 Senior Management should ensure that RE’s activities are conducted by staff with the necessary experience, technical capabilities and access to resources. The staff responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the RE’s risk policy should have authority independent from the units they oversee.\n\n5.15 An RE’s governance structure should be commensurate with the nature, size, complexity and risk profile of its activities. When designing the Operational Risk governance structure, an RE should take the following into consideration:\n\n5.15.1 Committee structure – A sound industry practice for larger and more complex organisations with a central group function and separate business units to utilise a Board-created enterprise-level risk committee for overseeing all risks, to which a management level Operational Risk Committee reports. Depending on the nature, size and complexity of the RE, the enterprise-level risk committee may receive input from Operational Risk committee(s), business or functional area. Smaller and less complex organisations may utilise a flatter organisational structure that oversees Operational Risk directly within the Board’s risk management committee.\n\n5.15.2 Committee composition – A sound industry practice for Operational Risk committees (or the risk committee in smaller REs) is to include members with a variety of expertise, which should cover expertise in business activities, financial activities, legal, technological and regulatory matters, and risk management.\n\n5.15.3 Committee operation – Committee meetings should be held at appropriate frequencies with adequate time and resources to permit productive discussion and decision-making. Records of committee operations should be adequate and documented to permit review and evaluation of committee effectiveness.\n\n5.16 Because Operational Risk Management is an evolving area, and the business environment is constantly changing, Senior Management should ensure that the RE’s policies, processes and systems under ORMF remain sufficiently robust to manage and ensure that operational losses are adequately addressed in a timely manner. Improvements in Operational Risk Management depend heavily on senior management’s willingness to be proactive and also act promptly and appropriately to address Operational Risk managers’ concerns."

Effective risk identification considers both internal and external factors. Sound risk assessment allows an RE to better understand its risk profile and allocate risk management resources and strategies most effectively.\n\nFor example, figure below shows the wide spectrum of risks (risk universe) which could be existing in third-party relationships.\n\n6.2 Examples of tools (indicative and not exhaustive) used for identifying and assessing Operational Risk are:\n\n6.2.1 Self-assessments – REs often perform self-assessments of their Operational Risks and controls at various levels. The assessments typically evaluate inherent risk (the risk before controls are considered), the effectiveness of the control environment, and residual risk (the risk exposure after controls are considered) and contain both quantitative (such as metrics, benchmarking, etc.) and qualitative (such as likelihood and consequence of the risk event in determination of inherent and residual risk ratings) elements. The assessments may utilise business process mapping to identify key steps in business processes, activities, and organisational functions, as well as the associated risks and areas of control weakness. The assessments should contain sufficiently detailed information on the business environment, Operational Risks, underlying causes, controls and evaluation of control effectiveness to enable an independent reviewer to determine how the RE reached its ratings. A risk register can be maintained to collate this information to form a meaningful view of the overall effectiveness of controls and facilitate oversight by senior management, risk committees, and the Board of Directors.\n\n6.2.2 Operational Risk event data – REs often maintain a comprehensive Operational Risk event dataset that collects all material events experienced by the RE and serves as basis for Operational Risk assessments. The event dataset typically includes internal loss data, near misses, etc., and is classified according to a taxonomy defined in the ORMF policies and consistently applied across the RE. It also includes the date of the event (occurrence date, discovery date and accounting date) and, in the case of loss events, financial impact. When other root cause information for events is available, ideally it can also be included in the Operational Risk dataset. Where feasible, REs are encouraged to also seek to gather external Operational Risk event data and use this data in their internal analysis, as it is often informative of risks that are common across the industry.\n\n6.2.3 Event management – A sound event management approach typically includes analysis of events to identify new Operational Risks, understanding the underlying causes and control weaknesses, and formulating an appropriate response to prevent recurrence of similar events. This information is an input to the self-assessment and, in particular, to the assessment of control effectiveness.\n\n6.2.4 Control monitoring and assurance framework – Incorporating an appropriate control monitoring and assurance framework facilitates a structured approach to the evaluation, review and ongoing monitoring and testing of key controls. The analysis of controls ensures these are suitably designed for the identified risks and are operating effectively. The analysis should also consider the sufficiency of control coverage, including adequate prevention, detection and response strategies. The control monitoring and testing should be appropriate for the different Operational Risks and across business areas. Further details on control and mitigation are given in paragraph 9 of this Guidance Note.\n\n6.2.5 Metrics – Using Operational Risk event data and risk and control assessments, REs often develop metrics to assess and monitor their Operational Risk exposure. These metrics may be simple indicators, such as event counts, or result from more sophisticated exposure models. Metrics provide early warning information to monitor ongoing performance of the business and the control environment, and to report the Operational Risk profile. Effective metrics clearly link the associated Operational Risks and controls. Monitoring metrics and related trends through time against laid down thresholds or limits or tolerance levels provides valuable information for risk management and reporting purposes.\n\n6.2.6 Scenario analysis – Scenario analysis is a method to identify, measure and analyse a range of scenarios, including low probability and high severity events, some of which could result in severe Operational Risk losses. It typically involves workshops or meetings of subject matter experts including senior management, business management and senior Operational Risk staff and other functional areas such as compliance, human resources and IT risk management, to develop and analyse the drivers and range of consequences of potential events. Inputs to the scenario analysis would typically include relevant internal and external loss data, information from self-assessments, the control monitoring and assurance framework, forward-looking metrics, root-cause analyses and the process framework. The scenario analysis process could be used to develop a range of consequences of potential events, including impact assessments for risk management purposes, supplementing other tools based on historical data or current risk assessments. An RE must carry out regular scenario analysis using the above parameters, for testing its ability to remain within its impact tolerance in the event disruption of its operations, for each of its critical services. In carrying out the scenario analysis, an RE must identify the range of adverse circumstances of varying nature, severity and duration, relevant to its business and risk profile and consider the risks to delivery of the RE’s critical services in those circumstances. Such an exercise could also be integrated with disaster recovery and business continuity plans, for further testing of operational resilience. Given the subjectivity of the scenario process, a robust governance framework and independent review are important to ensure the integrity and consistency of the process.\n\n6.2.7 Benchmarking and comparative analysis – Benchmarking and comparative analysis are comparisons of the outcomes of different risk measurement and management tools deployed within the RE, as well as comparisons of metrics of the RE, with other REs in the industry. Such comparisons can be performed to enhance understanding of the RE’s Operational Risk profile. For example, comparing the frequency and severity of internal losses with self-assessments can help the RE determine whether its self-assessment processes are functioning effectively. Scenario analysis data can be compared with internal and external loss data to gain a better understanding of the severity of the RE’s exposure to potential risk events.\n\n6.3 REs should ensure that the Operational Risk assessment tools’ outputs are:\n\n6.3.1 based on accurate data, whose integrity is ensured by strong governance and robust verification and validation procedures;\n\n6.3.2 adequately taking into account the internal pricing and performance measurement mechanisms as well as business opportunities assessments; and\n\n6.3.3 subject to OORF-monitored action plans or remediation plans when necessary.\n\n6.4 These Operational Risk assessment tools directly contribute to an RE’s operational resilience approach, in particular event management, self-assessment and scenario analysis procedures, as they allow REs to identify and monitor both internal and external threats and vulnerabilities to their critical operations. REs should use the outputs of these tools on a regular basis and in a timely manner to manage, address and improve their operational resilience controls and procedures so as to prevent them from affecting critical operations delivery. In doing so, the Operational Risk Management function should work alongside other relevant functions. These assessments should also be conducted in the event of changes to any underlying components of the critical operations, as well as after incidents in order to take into account lessons learned and new threats and vulnerabilities, if any, that caused the incident."

Change management should assess the evolution of associated risks across time, from inception to termination (e.g. throughout the full life cycle of a product8).\n\n7.2 An RE should have policies and procedures defining the process for identifying, managing, challenging, approving and monitoring change on the basis of agreed objective criteria.

A sound internal control programme consists of four components that are integral to the risk management process: risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring activities.10\n\n9.2 Control processes and procedures should include a system for ensuring compliance with policies, regulations and laws. Examples of principal elements of a policy compliance assessment are:\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\n9.3 Controls processes and procedures should address how the RE ensures continuity of operations in both normal circumstances and in the event of disruption, reflecting respective functions’ due diligence, consistent with the RE’s operational resilience approach.\n\n9.4 An effective control environment also requires appropriate segregation of duties. Assignments that establish conflicting duties for individuals or a team, without dual controls {e.g., a process that uses two or more separate entities (usually persons) operating in concert to protect sensitive functions or information} or other countermeasures, may result in concealment of losses, errors or other inappropriate actions. Therefore, areas where conflicts of interest may arise should be identified, minimised, and be subject to careful monitoring and review.\n\n9.5 In addition to segregation of duties and dual controls, REs should ensure that other traditional internal controls are in place, as appropriate, to address Operational Risk. Some of the examples of these controls are given in table below:\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\n9.6 Effective use and sound implementation of technology can contribute to the control environment. For example, automated processes are less prone to error than manual processes. However, automated processes introduce risks that should be addressed through sound technology governance and infrastructure risk management programmes.\n\n9.7 The use of technology related products, services, activities, processes and delivery channels exposes an RE to Operational Risk and the possibility of material financial loss. Consequently, an RE should have an integrated approach to identifying, measuring, monitoring and managing technology risks along the same precepts as Operational Risk Management. (Also refer to paragraph 15 of this Guidance Note)\n\n9.8 While recourse to entities such as, but not limited to third-party service providers can help manage costs, provide expertise, expand product offerings, and improve services, it also introduces risks that RE should address. The integrated approach adopted by RE for its ORMF should necessarily include such third-party dependencies. Amongst others, the concentration of risk, complexity and downstream dependencies with regard to third-party service providers should be taken into account. While these risks may be unavoidable, identifying and monitoring of such risks would allow REs to initiate actions that could reasonably mitigate or manage them. These risk policies and risk management activities should include critical operations management and dependency management. (Also refer to paragraph 12 of this Guidance Note)\n\n9.9 In those circumstances where internal controls do not adequately address risk and exiting the risk is not a reasonable option, management may complement controls by seeking to transfer the risk to another party such as through insurance. The Board of Directors should determine the maximum loss exposure the RE is willing to take and has the financial capacity to assume and should perform an annual review of the RE's risk and insurance management programme, including specific insurance or risk transfer needs of an RE.\n\n9.10 Because risk transfer is an imperfect substitute for sound controls and risk management programmes, REs should view risk transfer tools as complementary to, rather than a replacement for internal Operational Risk controls. Having mechanisms in place to quickly identify, recognise and rectify distinct Operational Risk errors can greatly reduce exposures. Careful consideration also needs to be given to the extent to which risk mitigation tools such as insurance truly reduce risk, transfer the risk to another business sector or area, or create a new risk (e.g., counterparty risk, legal risk)."

Activities such as risk identification and assessment, risk mitigation (including the implementation of controls) and the monitoring of risks and control effectiveness work together to minimise operational disruptions and their effects. The overarching principle of operational resilience is the acceptance that disruptions will occur, and that REs need to be prepared to respond accordingly and have measures in place to limit the impact. The REs need to ensure that they have prepared effectively, and have the flexibility to withstand, absorb, respond, adapt and recover and learn from disruptions with minimal impact on their critical operations. Further, management’s focus on the RE’s ability to respond to and recover from disruptions, assuming failures will occur, will support operational resilience. An operationally resilient RE is less prone to incur untimely lapses in its operations and losses from disruptions, thus lessening impact on critical operations and related services, functions and systems. While it may not be possible to avoid certain Operational Risks, such as a pandemic, it is possible to improve the resilience of an RE’s operations to such events.\n\n10.2 Business continuity, dependencies on third parties, and the technology upon which REs rely are important factors for REs to consider when strengthening their operational resilience.\n\n10.3 It is essential for REs to ensure that existing risk management frameworks, business continuity plans, and third-party dependency management are implemented consistently within the organisation. As operational resilience draws from such elements like business continuity, third-party risk management, ICT & cyber risk management, incident management, and wider aspects of Operational Risk Management, a holistic approach is essential if an RE is to enhance the resilience of its critical operations, regardless of the type of disruption. Approaching operational resilience through a critical operations lens encourages an RE to prioritise what is critical or important to the RE and the financial system, and understand the interconnections and interdependencies involved in delivering those operations. REs should therefore verify that their operational resilience approach is appropriately harmonised with the stated actions, organisational mappings, critical operations and critical shared services (including the services which are essential for the industry) contained in their recovery and resolution plans, which ultimately are important for the financial system stability."

Such a mapping will enable the RE to pinpoint vulnerabilities in how critical operations are being delivered and determine where recovery and resolution plans can be leveraged. Examples of such vulnerabilities could include concentration risk, single points of failure, and inadequate substitutability of service providers and resources.\n\n11.4 Where an RE is a member of a group, it must ensure that any additional risks arising elsewhere in the group are accounted for that may affect its ability to tackle with a severe but plausible disruption to its operations."

Prior to entering into such an arrangement, the RE should verify whether the third party, including, the intragroup entity to these arrangements, has at least an equivalent level of operational resilience to safeguard the RE’s critical operations in both normal circumstances and the event of a disruption.\n\nFew examples of what constitute third-party service providers is shown in figure below (indicative and not an exhaustive list)\n\n12.2 The Board of Directors and Senior Management are responsible for understanding the Operational Risks associated with third-party arrangements and ensuring that effective risk management policies and practices are in place to manage the risk in such activities. A Board approved policy on management of service providers is critical for managing risks associated with reliance on third parties whether related or unrelated to RE. Third-party risk policies (as a part of the ORMF’s policies) and risk management activities should encompass:\n\n12.2.1 Procedures for determining whether there is a need for entering into a third-party arrangement for a service and how to enter into such an arrangement.\n\n12.2.2 Processes for conducting due diligence in the selection of potential service providers.\n\n12.2.3 Sound structuring of the third-party arrangement, including ownership and confidentiality of data, as well as termination rights.\n\n12.2.4 Programmes for managing and monitoring the risks associated with the third-party arrangement, including the financial condition of the service provider.\n\n12.2.5 Establishment of an effective control environment at the RE and the service provider that should include a register of third-party relationships (that identifies the criticality of different services) and metrics and reporting to facilitate oversight of the service provider.\n\n12.2.6 Development of viable contingency plans.\n\n12.2.7 Execution of comprehensive contracts and/or service level agreements (which are enforceable) with a clear allocation of responsibilities between the third-party service provider and the RE, provided the ultimate responsibility vests with the RE.\n\n12.2.8 REs’ supervisory and resolution authorities’ access to third parties.\n\n12.3 REs should develop appropriate business continuity including contingency planning procedures and exit strategies to maintain their operational resilience in the event of a failure or disruption at a third-party level impacting the provision of critical operations. Scenarios under the RE’s business continuity plans should assess the substitutability of third parties that provide services to the RE’s critical operations, and other viable alternatives that may facilitate operational resilience in the event of an outage at a third party, such as bringing the service back in-house.\n\n12.4 Along with an increasing reliance on service providers, complexity in supply chains have also risen. A large number of service providers are subcontracting the services who are themselves reliant on another service provider for the provision of a service (a fourth party). In certain cases, these fourth party service providers can, in turn, be reliant upon yet another service provider, and further till nth service provider, thus elongating the chain. Such an arrangement results in an RE relying on downstream service providers without a direct agreement in place. Such supply chain vulnerabilities and lack of transparency may increase Operational Risk for RE. This can also impede its ability to manage risks in the supply chain as well have an effect on the regulator’s expectations on the RE. Therefore, REs are expected to be aware of, and manage, the risks associated with any further downstream service providers, to maintain a thorough understanding of the supply chain and potential issues that could affect the entity’s ability to maintain its critical operations. Therefore, REs, in their agreement with the service providers, should include clauses making the service provider contractually liable for the performance and risk management practices of its sub-contractors (including nth parties in the supply chain)."

Business continuity exercises should be conducted and validated for a range of severe but plausible scenarios that incorporate disruptive events and incidents. Among other business continuity goals, business continuity exercises should support staff’s operational resilience awareness including training of staff which should be customised based on specific cases so that they can effectively adapt and respond to incidents.\n\n13.4 Business continuity plans should provide detailed guidance for implementing the RE’s disaster recovery framework. These plans should establish the roles and responsibilities for managing operational disruptions and provide clear guidance regarding the succession of authority in the event of a disruption that impacts key personnel.

Business continuity procedures should be tested periodically to ensure that recovery and resumption objectives and timeframes can be met.

Results of formal testing and review activities should be reported to Senior Management and the Board of Directors.\n\n13.7 In view of Covid-19, preparing for future pandemics of varied kind should be one of REs’ top priorities. One key challenge REs face in such pandemics is the possibility of low staff availability which could potentially disrupt business operations for prolonged periods. The Business Continuity Planning of an RE should therefore include measures to mitigate the impact of such future pandemics. REs should put in place a comprehensive organisation-wide preparedness and response plan to deal with the different stages of a future outbreak or any such unforeseeable circumstances.

An RE should disclose its ORMF in a manner that allows stakeholders to determine whether the RE identifies, assesses, monitors and controls/mitigates Operational Risk effectively.\n\n16.3 REs should have a formal disclosure policy that is subject to regular and independent review and approval by the Senior Management and the Board of Directors, respectively. The policy should address the RE’s approach for determining what Operational Risk disclosures it will make and the internal controls over the disclosure process. In addition, REs should implement a process for assessing the appropriateness of their disclosures and disclosure policy.\n\n16.4 Where possible, direct reporting mechanisms with supervisors and auditors may be established for ensuring an ongoing review of the ORMF also enabling supervisors to encourage REs’ ongoing internal development efforts by monitoring, comparing and evaluating REs’ recent improvements and plans for prospective developments."

This includes any potential material disruption to a third-party provider (including but not limited to a group entity) that feeds into the delivery of a critical business service.\n\n17.2 The lessons learned exercise should utilise the information gathered as part of the incident management and disaster recovery process. The decisions and recovery processes determined to be appropriate throughout the incident management process should form the basis of the lessons learned exercise.\n\n17.3 An RE should have predetermined criteria or questions basis the lessons learned exercise from the incidents. These questions should identify deficiencies, which caused induced failure in the continuity of service and these deficiencies should be addressed as a matter of priority. Specifically, at a minimum, the following should be considered:\n\n17.4 The lessons learned exercises should define effective remediation measures to redress deficiencies and failure in the continuity of service. The more efficient use of resources for critical operations and adjustments to any impact tolerances determine whether a failure could have a wider impact on financial stability. A report/ self-assessment analysis document post the incident containing the above should be presented to the Board.\n\n17.5 The lessons learned exercise allows an RE to reflect on the three-pillar approach to operational resilience and allows for a feedback loop into the first two pillars that encourages improvement in how an RE prepares for and recovers from disruptions. Doing so will also allow an RE to agree remedial actions and adjust any impact tolerances if determined."

This should not only occur after a disruption or incident has occurred but should form part of ongoing operational resilience discussions.\n\n18.2 An RE should promote an effective culture of learning and continuous improvement as operational resilience evolves. Operational resilience needs to be a fundamental element of any strategic decision taken by an RE.\n\n18.3 REs should develop robust feedback systems to ensure a continuous positive feedback loop fostering an effective learning environment, which in turn helps them frame better ORMFs and build adequate Operational Resilience.\n\n18.4 In the above context, an effective feedback system properly identifies and assesses the type, nature and severity of potential Operational Risks that could be faced by an RE as well as where the vulnerabilities lie and need to be addressed. Based on the same, a required set of control and mitigation measures can be developed to tackle these risks. Further, based on real time operational incidents or disruptions that have occurred despite the mitigation measures, the feedback system updates the type, nature and severity of potential Operational Risks and hence updates the required set of control and mitigation measures to tackle these risks. Errors/mistakes in the existing controls and processes should also be incorporated in the feedback for ensuring rectification and necessary updation. In this way, through feedback, an RE maintains optimal operational resilience as shown in figure below."

However, REs such as Small Finance Banks, Payments Banks, Regional Rural Banks, Local Area Banks, NBFCs, and Co-operative Banks are not required to maintain separate regulatory capital for operational risk.\n\n2 “Commercial Banks” means all banking companies, corresponding new banks, Regional Rural Banks and State Bank of India as defined under subsections (c), (da), (ja) and (nc) of Section 5 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. This also includes banks incorporated outside India and licensed to operate in India (‘Foreign Banks’), Local Area Banks, Payments Banks, and Small Finance Banks.\n\n3 According to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), critical functions are defined as “activities performed for third parties where failure would lead to the disruption of services that are vital for the functioning of the real economy and for financial stability due to the RE’s group size or market share, external and internal interconnectedness, complexity and cross-border activities. Examples include payments, custody, certain lending and deposit-taking activities in the commercial or retail sector, clearing and settling, limited segments of wholesale markets, market making in certain securities and highly concentrated specialist lending sectors.” (FSB’s guidance on ‘Recovery and resolution planning for systemically important financial institutions: guidance on identification of critical functions and critical shared services’, dated July 16, 2013)\n\n4 In this context, “supporting assets” are defined as people, technology, information and facilities necessary for the delivery of critical operations.\n\n5 As per the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), USA, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) encompasses all technologies for the capture, storage, retrieval, processing, display, representation, organization, management, security, transfer, and interchange of data and information.\n\n6 “Commercial Banks” means all banking companies, corresponding new banks, Regional Rural Banks and State Bank of India as defined under subsections (c), (da), (ja) and (nc) of Section 5 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. This also includes banks incorporated outside India licensed to operate in India (‘Foreign Banks’), Local Area Banks, Payments Banks, and Small Finance Banks.\n\n7 “Risk appetite” is defined in BCBS’s 2015 Corporate governance guidelines, which use the FSB’s 2013 Principles for an effective risk appetite framework.\n\n8 The life cycle of a product or service encompasses various stages from the development, ongoing changes, grandfathering and closure. Indeed, the level of risk may escalate for example when new products, services, activities, processes, or systems transition from an introductory level to a level that represents material sources of revenue or business-critical operations.\n\n9 Reporting should be consistent with BCBS’ Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting (https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs239.pdf).\n\n10 BCBS paper on “Framework for Internal Control Systems in Banking Organisations, September 1998” discusses internal controls in greater detail.\n\n11 The management of dependencies articulated in this principle should be consistent with and conducted alongside the control and risk mitigation policies (principle 9) of this Guidance Note.\n\n12 Recognising that the life cycle of an incident could span multiple measures of time that could range from hours to weeks to months."

During the course of the onsite examination of REs for the period ended March 31, 2023, the Reserve Bank came across instances of lenders resorting to certain unfair practices in charging of interest. Some of the unfair practices observed are briefly explained below:\n\n3. These and other such non-standard practices of charging interest are not in consonance with the spirit of fairness and transparency while dealing with customers. These are matters of serious concern to the Reserve Bank. Wherever such practices have come to light, RBI through its supervisory teams has advised REs to refund such excess interest and other charges to customers. REs are also being encouraged to use online account transfers in lieu of cheques being issued in a few cases for loan disbursal.\n\n4. Therefore, in the interest of fairness and transparency, all REs are directed to review their practices regarding mode of disbursal of loans, application of interest and other charges and take corrective action, including system level changes, as may be necessary, to address the issues highlighted above.\n\n5. This circular takes immediate effect.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Tarun Singh)    Chief General Manager"

On investigation, it has been observed that to facilitate unauthorised forex trading, these entities have taken recourse to engaging local agents who open accounts at different bank branches for collecting money towards margin, investment, charges, etc. These accounts are opened in the name of individuals, proprietary concerns, trading firms etc. and the transactions in such accounts are not found to be commensurate with the stated purpose for opening the account in several cases. It is also observed that these entities are providing options to residents to remit/deposit funds in Rupees for undertaking unauthorised forex transactions using domestic payment systems like online transfers, payment gateways, etc.\n\n2. In this context, attention of Authorised Dealer Category-I (AD Cat-I) banks is invited to:\n\n3. There is a need for greater vigilance to prevent the misuse of banking channels in facilitating unauthorised forex trading. AD Cat-I banks are, therefore, advised to be more vigilant and exercise greater caution in this regard. As and when AD Cat-I banks come across an account being used to facilitate unauthorised forex trading, they shall report the same to the Directorate of Enforcement, Government of India, for further action, as deemed fit.\n\n4. AD Cat-I banks may bring the contents of this circular to the notice of their constituents and customers concerned. AD Cat-I banks may advise their customers to deal in forex only with ‘Authorised Persons’ and on ‘authorised ETPs’ and give wide publicity to the list of ‘Authorised Persons’ and the list of ‘authorised ETPs’ available on the RBI website. AD Cat-I banks are also advised to give publicity to the ‘Alert List’ and Press Releases issued by the RBI in this regard.\n\n5. The directions contained in this circular have been issued under sections 10(4) and 11 (1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) and are without prejudice to permissions / approvals, if any, required under any other law.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Dimple Bhandia)    Chief General Manager"

                "title": "Key Features of DAY-NRLM",
                "content": "1. Universal Social Mobilization: To begin with, DAY-NRLM would ensure that at least one member from each identified rural poor household, preferably a woman, is brought under the SHG network in a time bound manner. Subsequently, both women and men would be organized for addressing livelihood issues i.e., farmers organizations, milk producers’ cooperatives, weavers’ associations, etc. All these institutions are inclusive and no poor would be left out of them. DAY-NRLM would ensure adequate coverage of vulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of the beneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are minorities and 3% are persons with disability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of all households under the automatically included criteria and households with at least one deprivation criterion as per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC).\n\n2. Participatory Identification of poor (PIP): DAY-NRLM would undertake a community based process for covering the target beneficiaries i.e., participation of the poor in the process of identifying the target group. Participatory process based on sound methodology and tools (social mapping and well-being categorization, deprivation indicators) and also locally understood and accepted criteria ensures local consensus that inadvertently reduces the inclusion and exclusion errors and enables formation of the groups on the basis of mutual affinity.\n\nThe households identified with at least one deprivation criteria as per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) along with households identified through the P.I.P process would be accepted as DAY-NRLM target group and would be eligible for all the benefits under the programme. The list finalized after P.I.P process would be vetted by the Gram Sabha and approved by the Gram Panchayat.\n\nTill the P.I.P process is undertaken by the State in a particular district/block, the rural households with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC list would be targeted under DAY-NRLM. As already provided in the Framework for implementation of DAY-NRLM, up to 30% of the total membership of the SHGs may be from among the population marginally above the poverty line, subject to the approval of other members of the group. This 30% also includes the poor households whose name does not figure in the SECC list but are as poor as those included in SECC list.\n\n3. Promotion of Institutions of the poor: Strong institutions of the poor such as SHGs and their village level and higher-level federations are necessary to provide space, voice and resources for the poor and for reducing their dependence on external agencies. They empower them and also act as instruments of knowledge and technology dissemination, and hubs of production, collectivization and commerce. DAY-NRLM, therefore, would focus on setting up these institutions at various levels. In addition, DAY-NRLM would promote specialized institutions like Livelihoods collectives, producers’ cooperative/companies for livelihoods promotion through deriving economies of scale, backward and forward linkages, and access to information, credit, technology, markets etc. The Livelihoods collectives would enable the poor to optimize their limited resource.\n\n4. Strengthening all existing SHGs and federations of the poor. There are existing institutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of NGOs. DAY- NRLM would strengthen all existing institutions of the poor in a partnership mode. The self-help promoting institutions both in the Government and in the NGO sector would promote social accountability practices to introduce greater transparency. This would be in addition to the mechanisms that would be evolved by SRLMs and state governments. The learning from one another underpins the key processes of learning in DAY-NRLM.\n\n5. Emphasis on Training, Capacity Building and Skill Building: DAY-NRLM would ensure that the poor are provided with the requisite skills for managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods, enhancing their credit absorption capacity and credit worthiness, etc. A multi-pronged approach is envisaged for continuous capacity building of the targeted families, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders. Particular focus would be on developing and engaging community professionals and community resource persons for capacity building of SHGs and their federations and other collectives. DAY- NRLM would make extensive use of Information, Communication & Technology (ICT) to make knowledge dissemination and capacity building more effective.\n\n6. Revolving Fund and Community Investment Support Fund (C.I.F): A Revolving Fund would be provided to eligible SHGs as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thrift and accumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long-run and immediate consumption needs in the short-run. The C.I.F would be a corpus and used for meeting the members’ credit needs directly and as catalytic capital for leveraging repeat bank finance. The C.I.F would be routed to the SHGs through the Federations. The key to coming out of poverty is continuous and easy access to finance, at reasonable rates, till they accumulate their own funds in large measure.\n\n7. Universal Financial Inclusion: DAY-NRLM would work towards achieving universal financial inclusion, beyond basic banking services to all the poor households, SHGs and their federations. DAY-NRLM would work on both demand and supply side of Financial Inclusion. On the demand side, it would promote financial literacy among the poor and provide catalytic capital to the SHGs and their federations. On the supply side, it would coordinate with the financial sector and encourage use of ICT based financial technologies, business correspondents and community facilitators like ‘Bank Mitras’. It would also work towards universal coverage of rural poor against loss of life, health and assets. Further, it would work on remittances, especially in areas where migration is endemic.\n\n8. Provision of Interest Subvention: The rural poor need credit at low rate of interest and in multiple doses to make their ventures economically viable. In order to ensure affordable credit, DAY-NRLM has a provision for subvention on interest rates.\n\n9. Funding Pattern: DAY-NRLM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the financing of the programme would be shared between the Centre and the States in the ratio of 60:40 (90:10 in case of North Eastern States including Sikkim; completely from the Centre in case of UTs). The Central allocation earmarked for the states would broadly be distributed in relation to the incidence of poverty in the states.\n\n10. Implementation in Blocks: The blocks that are taken up for implementation of DAY-NRLM would have a full complement of trained professional staff and cover a whole range of activities of universal and intense social and financial inclusion, livelihoods, partnerships etc.\n\n11. Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs). RSETI concept is built on the model pioneered by Rural Development Self Employment Institute (RUDSETI) – a collaborative partnership between SDME Trust and Canara Bank. The model envisages transforming unemployed youth into confident self-employed entrepreneurs through a short duration experiential learning programme followed by systematic long duration hand holding support. The need-based training builds entrepreneurship qualities, improves self-confidence, reduces risk of failure and develops the trainees into change agents. Banks are fully involved in selection, training and post training follow up stages. The needs of the poor articulated through the institutions of the poor would guide RSETIs in preparing the participants/trainees in their pursuits of self-employment and enterprises. DAY-NRLM would encourage public sector banks to set up RSETIs in all districts of the country."

Banks should advise their branches to organize meetings more frequently exclusively for SC/ST beneficiaries to understand their credit needs and to incorporate the same in the credit plan.\n\n2.3 Circulars issued by RBI/NABARD should be circulated among the staff for compliance.\n\n2.4 Banks should not insist on deposits while considering loan applications under Government sponsored poverty alleviation schemes/self-employment programmes from borrowers belonging to SCs/STs. It should also be ensured that applicable subsidy is not held back while releasing the loan component till the full repayment of bank dues.

Details of the scheme are available in the Master Circular on DAY-NULM as updated from time to time.\n\n4.3 Differential Rate of Interest (DRI) Scheme\n\nUnder the DRI Scheme, banks provide finance up to ₹15,000/- at a concessional rate of interest of 4 per cent per annum to the weaker sections of the community for engaging in productive and gainful activities. In order to ensure that persons belonging to SCs/STs also derive adequate benefit under the DRI Scheme, banks have been advised to grant eligible borrowers belonging to SCs/STs such advances to the extent of not less than 2/5th (40 percent) of total DRI advances. Further, the eligibility criteria under DRI, viz. size of land holding should not exceed 1 acre of irrigated land and 2.5 acres of unirrigated land, are not applicable to SCs/STs.

Any major gap or variation in credit flow to SCs/STs on a year to year basis should be reported to the Board as part of the review on the theme of “Financial Inclusion” in terms of circular DBR No.BC.93/29.67.001/2014-15 dated May 14, 2015.\n\n6.3 Banks should review the measures taken to enhance the flow of credit to SC/ST borrowers on a quarterly basis.

As announced in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated February 8, 2024, it has been decided to harmonize the instructions on the subject. This is being done in order to enhance transparency and reduce information asymmetry on financial products being offered by different regulated entities, thereby empowering borrowers for making an informed financial decision. The harmonised instructions shall be applicable in cases of all retail and MSME term loan products extended by all regulated entities (REs).\n\n3. For the purpose of this circular, following terms have been defined:\n\n(a) Key Facts of a loan agreement between an RE/a group of REs and a borrower are legally significant and deterministic facts that satisfy basic information required to assist the borrower in taking an informed financial decision.\n\n(b) Key Facts Statement (KFS) is a statement of key facts of a loan agreement, in simple and easier to understand language, provided to the borrower in a standardised format.\n\n(c) Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the annual cost of credit to the borrower which includes interest rate and all other charges associated with the credit facility.\n\n(d) Equated Periodic Instalment (EPI) is an equated or fixed amount of repayments, consisting of both the principal and interest components, to be paid by a borrower towards repayment of a loan at periodic intervals for a fixed number of such intervals; and which result in complete amortisation of the loan. EPIs at monthly intervals are called EMIs.\n\nOther words and expressions not defined above, but used in this circular, shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under the Master Direction on Interest Rate on Advances (2016) as updated from time to time or any other relevant regulation issued by the Reserve Bank.\n\n4. REs shall provide a KFS to all prospective borrowers to help them take an informed view before executing the loan contract, as per the standardised format given in the Annex A. The KFS shall be written in a language understood by such borrowers. Contents of KFS shall be explained to the borrower and an acknowledgement shall be obtained that he/she has understood the same.\n\n5. Further, the KFS shall be provided with a unique proposal number and shall have a validity period of at least three working days for loans having tenor of seven days or more, and a validity period of one working day for loans having tenor of less than seven days.1\n\nExplanation\n\nValidity period refers to the period available to the borrower, after being provided the KFS by the RE, to agree to the terms of the loan. The RE shall be bound by the terms of the loan indicated in the KFS, if agreed to by the borrower during the validity period.\n\n6. The KFS shall also include a computation sheet of annual percentage rate (APR), and the amortisation schedule of the loan over the loan tenor. APR will include all charges which are levied by the RE. Illustrative examples of calculation of APR and disclosure of repayment schedule for a hypothetical loan are given in Annex B and C respectively.\n\n7. Charges recovered from the borrowers by the REs on behalf of third-party service providers on actual basis, such as insurance charges, legal charges etc., shall also form part of the APR and shall be disclosed separately. In all cases wherever the RE is involved in recovering such charges, the receipts and related documents shall be provided to the borrower for each payment, within a reasonable time.\n\n8. Any fees, charges, etc. which are not mentioned in the KFS, cannot be charged by the REs to the borrower at any stage during the term of the loan, without explicit consent of the borrower.\n\n9. The KFS shall also be included as a summary box to be exhibited as part of the loan agreement."

Accordingly, the date of SMA-1 classification for that account shall be April 30, 2022.\n\nSimilarly, if the account continues to remain overdue, it shall get tagged as SMA-2 upon running day-end process on May 30, 2022 and if continues to remain overdue further, it shall get classified as NPA upon running day-end process on June 29, 2022.\n\n(iii) UCBs having total assets of ₹2000 crore or above as on March 31, 2020 were required to implement system-based asset classification4 with effect from June 30, 2021.\n\n(iv) UCBs having total assets of ₹1000 crore or above but less than ₹2000 crore as on March 31, 2020 and having self-assessed themselves as being under Level III or Level IV in terms of the circular DoS.CO/CSITE/BC.4083/31.01.052/2019-20 dated December 31, 2019 on Comprehensive Cyber Security Framework for UCBs were required to implement system-based asset classification with effect from September 30, 2021.\n\n(v) UCBs which meet the above criteria as at the end of the financial year 2020-2021 or subsequent financial years shall implement system-based asset classification within a period of six months from the end of the financial year concerned.

                "content": "The prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances are detailed a under:\n\n(a) Asset Classification Norms\n\n2.2.7.1 Restructuring of advances could take place in the following stages:\n\n2.2.7.2 The accounts classified as 'standard assets' should be immediately re-classified as 'sub-standard assets' upon restructuring.\n\n2.2.7.3 The non performing assets, upon restructuring, would slip into further lower asset classification category as per extant asset classification norms with reference to the pre-restructuring repayment schedule.\n\n2.2.7.4 All restructured accounts which have been classified as non-performing assets upon restructuring, would be eligible for upgradation to the 'standard' category after observation of 'satisfactory performance' during the 'specified period' (Annex 5).\n\n2.2.7.5 In case, however, satisfactory performance during the specified period is not evidenced, the asset classification of the restructured account would be governed as per the applicable prudential norms with reference to the pre-restructuring payment schedule.\n\n2.2.7.6 Any additional finance may be treated as 'standard asset', up to a period of one year after the first interest / principal payment, whichever is earlier, falls due under the approved restructuring package. However, in the case of accounts where the pre-restructuring facilities were classified as 'sub-standard' and 'doubtful', interest income on the additional finance should be recognised only on cash basis. If the restructured asset does not qualify for upgradation at the end of the above specified one year period, the additional finance shall be placed in the same asset classification category as the restructured debt.\n\n2.2.7.7 In respect of loan accounts which enjoy special regulatory treatment as per para 2.2.7.25, upon restructuring, such non-performing assets would continue to have the same asset classification as prior to restructuring. In case satisfactory performance of the account is not evidenced during the 'specified period', it would slip into further lower asset classification categories as per extant asset classification norms with reference to the pre-restructuring repayment schedule.\n\n2.2.7.8 In case a restructured asset, which is a standard asset on restructuring, is subjected to restructuring on a subsequent occasion, it should be classified as substandard. If the restructured asset is a sub-standard or a doubtful asset and is subjected to restructuring, on a subsequent occasion, its asset classification will be reckoned from the date when it became NPA on the first occasion. However, such advances restructured on second or more occasion may be allowed to be upgraded to standard category after one year from the date of first payment of interest or repayment of principal whichever falls due earlier in terms of the current restructuring package subject to satisfactory performance.\n\n(b) Income Recognition Norms\n\n2.2.7.9 Subject to provisions of paragraphs 2.2.7.6 and 2.2.7.22 interest income in respect of restructured accounts classified as 'standard assets' will be recognized on accrual basis and that in respect of the account classified as 'non performing assets' will be recognized on cash basis.\n\n(c) Provisioning Norms\n\n2.2.7.10 Normal Provisions\n\nBanks will hold provision against the restructured advances on the basis of classification of assets into prescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 below.\n\n2.2.7.11 Provision for Diminution in the Fair Value of restructured Advances\n\nThe erosion in the fair value of the advance should be computed as the difference between the fair value of the loan before and after restructuring. Fair value of the loan before restructuring will be computed as the present value of cash flows representing the interest at the existing rate charged on the advance before restructuring and the principal, discounted at a rate equal to the bank's BPLR as on the date of restructuring plus the appropriate term premium and credit risk premium for the borrower category on the date of restructuring';. Fair value of the loan after restructuring will be computed as the present value of cash flows representing the interest at the rate charged on the advance on restructuring and the principal, discounted at a rate equal to the bank's BPLR as on the date of restructuring plus the appropriate term premium and credit risk premium for the borrower category on the date of restructuring';.\n\n2.2.7.12 It may please be noted that the above formula moderates the swing in the diminution of present value of loans with the interest rate cycle and will have to be followed consistently in future.\n\n2.2.7.13 Further, it is reiterated that the provisions required as above arise due to the action of the banks resulting in change in contractual terms of the loan upon restructuring which are in the nature of financial concessions. These provisions are distinct from the provisions which are linked to the asset classification of the account classified as NPA and reflect the impairment due to deterioration in the credit quality of the loan. Thus, the two types of the provisions are not substitute for each other.\n\n2.2.7.14 It is also re-emphasised that the guidelines on restructuring of advances by RBI are aimed at providing an opportunity to banks and borrowers to preserve the economic value of the units and should not be looked at as a means to evergreen the advances.\n\n2.2.7.15 In their published annual Balance Sheets, banks shall make disclosures as per Annex-6\n\n2.2.7.16 In the case of working capital facilities, the diminution in the fair value of the cash credit / overdraft component may be computed as indicated in para 2.2.7.11 above, reckoning the higher of the outstanding amount or the limit sanctioned as the principal amount and taking the tenor of the advance as one year. The term premium in the discount factor would be as applicable for one year. The fair value of the term loan components (Working Capital Term Loan and Funded Interest Term Loan) would be computed as per actual cash flows and taking the term premium in the discount factor as applicable for the maturity of the respective term loan components.\n\n2.2.7.17 In the event any security is taken in lieu of the diminution in the fair value of the advance, it should be valued at Re.1 This will ensure that the effect of charging off the economic sacrifice to the Profit & Loss account is not negated.\n\n2.2.7.18 The diminution in the fair value may be re-computed on each balance sheet date till satisfactory completion of all repayment obligations and full repayment of the outstanding in the account, so as to capture the changes in the fair value on account of changes in BPLR, term premium and the credit category of the borrower. Consequently, banks may provide for the shortfall in provision or reverse the amount of excess provision held in the distinct account.\n\n2.2.7.19 If due to lack of expertise / appropriate infrastructure, a bank finds it difficult to ensure computation of diminution in the fair value of advances extended by small branches, as an alternative to the methodology prescribed above for computing the amount of diminution in the fair value, banks will have the option of notionally computing the amount of diminution in the fair value and providing therefore, at five percent of the total exposure, in respect of all restructured accounts where the total dues to bank(s) are less than rupees one crore.\n\n2.2.7.20 The total provisions required against an account (normal provisions plus provisions in lieu of diminution in the fair value of the advance) are capped at 100% of the outstanding debt amount.\n\n(d) Prudential Norms for Conversion of Unpaid Interest into 'Funded Interest Term Loan' (FITL)\n\n2.2.7.21 Asset Classification Norms\n\nThe FITL created by conversion of unpaid interest will be classified in the same asset classification category in which the restructured advance has been classified. Further movement in the asset classification of FITL would also be determined based on the subsequent asset classification of the restructured advance.\n\n2.2.7.22 Income Recognition Norms\n\n(i) The income, if any, generated may be recognised on accrual basis, if FITL is classified as 'standard', and on cash basis in the cases where the same has been classified as a non-performing asset.\n\n(ii) The unrealised income represented by FITL should have a corresponding credit in an account styled as ';Sundry Liabilities Account (Interest Capitalization)';.\n\n(iii) Only on repayment in case of FITL, the amount received will be recognized in the P&L Account, while simultaneously reducing the balance in the ';Sundry Liabilities Account (Interest Capitalisation)';.\n\n(e) Special Regulatory Treatment for Asset Classification\n\n2.2.7.23 The special regulatory treatment for asset classification, in modification to the provisions in this regard stipulated in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8, will be available to the borrowers engaged in important business activities, subject to compliance with certain conditions as enumerated in para 2.2.7.28 below. Such treatment is not extended to the following categories of advances:\n\n(i) Consumer and personal advances including advances to individuals against the securities of shares / bonds / debentures, etc.\n\n(ii) Advances to traders\n\n2.2.7.24 The asset classification of the above two categories of accounts as well as that of other accounts which do not comply with the conditions enumerated in para 2.2.7.28, will be governed by the prudential norms in this regard described in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8 above.\n\n(f) Elements of Special Regulatory Framework\n\n2.2.7.25 The special regulatory treatment has the following two components:\n\n(i) Incentive for quick implementation of the restructuring package.\n\n(ii) Retention of the asset classification of the restructured account in the pre restructuring asset classification category\n\n2.2.7.26 Incentive for Quick Implementation of the Restructuring Package\n\nDuring the pendency of the application for restructuring of the advance with the bank, the usual asset classification norms would continue to apply. The process of reclassification of an asset should not stop merely because the application is under consideration. However, as an incentive for quick implementation of the package, if the approved package is implemented by the bank within 90 days from the date of receipt of application by the bank, the asset classification status may be restored to the position which existed when the restructuring application was received by the bank.\n\n2.2.7.27 Asset Classification Benefits\n\nSubject to the compliance with the undernoted conditions in addition to the adherence to the prudential framework laid down in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8:\n\n(i) In modification to para 2.2.7.2, an existing 'standard asset' will not be downgraded to the sub-standard category upon restructuring.\n\n(ii) In modification to para 2.2.7.3, during the specified period, the asset classification of the sub-standard / doubtful accounts will not deteriorate upon restructuring, if satisfactory performance is demonstrated during the specified period.\n\n2.2.7.28 However, these benefits will be available subject to compliance with the following conditions:\n\ni) The dues to the bank are 'fully secured' as defined in Annex 5. The condition of being fully secured by tangible security will not be applicable in the following cases:\n\n(a) SSI borrowers, where the outstanding is up to ₹25 lakh.\n\n(b) infrastructure projects, provided the cash flows generated from these projects are adequate for repayment of the advance, the financing bank(s) have in place an appropriate mechanism to escrow the cash flows, and also have a clear and legal first claim on these cash flows.\n\n(c) WCTL created by conversion of the irregular portion of principal dues over the drawing power, subject to the condition that provisions are made against the unsecured portion of the WCTL, as under :\n\nii) The unit becomes viable in 10 years, if it is engaged in infrastructure activities, and in 7 years in the case of other units.\n\niii) The repayment period of the restructured advance including the moratorium, if any, does not exceed 15 years in the case of infrastructure advances and 10 years in the case of other advances. The Board of Directors of the banks should prescribe the maximum period not exceeding 15 years for restructured advances keeping in view the safety and soundness of advances.\n\niv) Promoters' sacrifice and additional funds brought by them should be a minimum of 15% of banks' sacrifice.\n\nv) Personal guarantee is offered by the promoter except when the unit is affected by external factors pertaining to the economy and industry.\n\nvi) The restructuring under consideration is not a 'repeated restructuring' as defined in para (iv) of Annex 5.\n\n(g) Disclosures\n\n2.2.7.29 Banks should disclose in their published annual Balance Sheets, under 'Notes on Accounts', information relating to number and amount of advances restructured and the amount of diminution in the fair value of the restructured advances in Annex 6.\n\n(h) Illustrations\n\n2.2.7.30 A few illustrations on the asset classification of restructured accounts are given in Annex 7.\n\n2.2.7.31 Resolution of Covid-19 related stress implemented under the following circulars shall be subject to the specific requirements, including the prudential requirements, specified therein:\n\n(i) DOR.No.BP.BC/3/21.04.048/2020-21 dated August 6, 2020 on “Resolution Framework for COVID-19-related Stress” read with DOR.No.BP.BC/13/21.04.048/2020-21 dated September 7, 2020 on “Resolution Framework for COVID-19-related Stress – Financial Parameters”;\n\n(ii) DOR.No.BP.BC/4/21.04.048/2020-21 dated August 6, 2020 on “Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector – Restructuring of Advances”;\n\n(iii) DOR.STR.REC.11/21.04.048/2021-22 dated May 5, 2021 on “Resolution Framework – 2.0: Resolution of Covid-19 related stress of Individuals and Small Businesses” read with DOR.STR.REC.20/21.04.048/2021-22 dated June 4, 2021 on “Resolution Framework - 2.0: Resolution of Covid-19 related stress of Individuals and Small Businesses – Revision in the threshold for aggregate exposure”;\n\n(iv) DOR.STR.REC.12/21.04.048/2021-22 dated May 5, 2021 on ‘Resolution Framework 2.0 – Resolution of Covid-19 related stress of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)’ read with DOR.STR.REC.21/21.04.048/2021-22 dated June 4, 2021 on ‘Resolution Framework - 2.0: Resolution of Covid-19 related stress of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) – Revision in the threshold for aggregate exposure’\n\n(v) The above may be read alongwith the FAQs on Resolution Framework for Covid-19 related stress updated from time to time.\n\n2.2.7.32 MSME accounts restructured under the circulars DBR.No.BP.BC.18/21.04.048/2018-19 dated January 1, 2019 and DOR.No.BP.BC.34/21.04.048/2019-20 dated February 11, 2020 shall be subject to the prudential requirements specified therein."

It will also be observed that the Balance Sheet format prescribed under the Third Schedule to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) specifically requires the banks to show 'Overdue Interest Reserve' as a distinct item on the 'Capital and Liabilities' side vide item 8 thereof."

                "content": "1. GENERAL\n\n1.1 In line with the international practices and as per the recommendations made by the Committee on the Financial System (Chairman Shri M. Narasimham), the Reserve Bank of India has introduced, in a phased manner, prudential norms for income recognition, asset classification and provisioning for the advances portfolio of the banks so as to move towards greater consistency and transparency in the published accounts.\n\n1.2 The policy of income recognition should be objective and based on record of recovery rather than on any subjective considerations. Likewise, the classification of assets of banks has to be done on the basis of objective criteria which would ensure a uniform and consistent application of the norms. Also, the provisioning should be made on the basis of the classification of assets based on the period for which the asset has remained non-performing and the availability of security and the realisable value thereof.\n\n1.3 Banks are urged to ensure that while granting loans and advances, realistic repayment schedules may be fixed on the basis of cash flows with borrowers. This would go a long way to facilitate prompt repayment by the borrowers and thus improve the record of recovery in advances.\n\n2. DEFINITIONS\n\n2.1 Non-performing Assets\n\n2.1.1 An asset, including a leased asset, becomes non-performing when it ceases to generate income for the bank.\n\n2.1.2 A non-performing asset (NPA) is a loan or an advance where;\n\n2.1.3 In addition, an account may also be classified as NPA in terms of certain specific provisions of this Master Circular, including inter alia Paragraphs 4.2.4, 4.2.9 and Part B2.\n\n2.2 ‘Out of Order’ status\n\n2.2.1 A CC/OD account shall be treated as ‘out of order’ if:\n\n2.2.2 The definition of “out of order” as at paragraph 2.2.1 above shall be applicable to all loan products being offered as an overdraft facility, including those not meant for business purpose and/or which entail interest repayments as the only credits.\n\n2.3 ‘Overdue’ status\n\n2.3.1 Any amount due to the bank under any credit facility is ‘overdue’ if it is not paid on the due date fixed by the bank. The borrower accounts shall be flagged as overdue by the banks as part of their day-end processes for the due date, irrespective of the time of running such processes.\n\n3. INCOME RECOGNITION\n\n3.1 Income Recognition Policy\n\n3.1.1 The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of recovery. Therefore, the banks should not charge and take to income account interest on any NPA. This will apply to Government guaranteed accounts also.\n\n3.1.2 However, interest on advances against Term Deposits, National Savings Certificates (NSCs), Kisan Vikas Patras (KVPs) and life insurance policies may be taken to income account on the due date, provided adequate margin is available in the accounts.\n\n3.1.3 Fees and commissions earned by the banks as a result of renegotiations or rescheduling of outstanding debts should be recognised on an accrual basis over the period of time covered by the renegotiated or rescheduled extension of credit.\n\n3.1.4 In cases of loans where moratorium has been granted for repayment of interest, income may be recognised on accrual basis for accounts which continue to be classified as ‘standard’. This shall be evaluated against the definition of ‘restructuring’ provided in paragraph 16 of this Master Circular.\n\n3.1.5 Income recognition norms for loans towards projects under implementation involving deferment of DCCO shall be subject to the instructions contained in paragraph 4.2.15 of this Master Circular and that for loans against gold ornaments and jewellery for non-agricultural purposes shall be subject to the instructions contained in circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.27/21.04.048/2014-15 dated July 22, 2014 on the subject, as updated from time to time.\n\n3.2 Reversal of income\n\n3.2.1 If any advance, including bills purchased and discounted, becomes NPA, the entire interest accrued and credited to income account in the past periods, should be reversed if the same is not realised. This will apply to Government guaranteed accounts also.\n\n3.2.2 If loans with moratorium on payment of interest (permitted at the time of sanction of the loan) become NPA after the moratorium period is over, the capitalized interest, if any, corresponding to the interest accrued during such moratorium period need not be reversed.\n\n3.2.3 In respect of NPAs, fees, commission and similar income that have accrued should cease to accrue in the current period and should be reversed with respect to past periods, if uncollected.\n\n3.2.4 Leased Assets - The finance charge component of finance income [as defined in ‘AS 19 Leases’)] on the leased asset which has accrued and was credited to income account before the asset became non-performing, and remaining unrealised, should be reversed or provided for in the current accounting period.\n\n3.3 Appropriation of recovery in NPAs\n\n3.3.1 Interest realised on NPAs may be taken to income account provided the credits in the accounts towards interest are not out of fresh/ additional credit facilities sanctioned to the borrower concerned.\n\n3.3.2 In the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the borrower for the purpose of appropriation of recoveries in NPAs (i.e. towards principal or interest due), banks should adopt an accounting principle and exercise the right of appropriation of recoveries in a uniform and consistent manner.\n\n3.4 Interest Application\n\nOn an account turning NPA, banks should reverse the interest already charged and not collected by debiting Profit and Loss account and stop further application of interest. However, banks may continue to record such accrued interest in a Memorandum account in their books. For the purpose of computing Gross Advances, interest recorded in the Memorandum account should not be taken into account.\n\n3.5 Computation of NPA levels\n\nBanks are advised to compute their Gross Advances, Net Advances, Gross NPAs and Net NPAs, as per the format in Annex -1.\n\n4. ASSET CLASSIFICATION\n\n4.1 Categories of NPAs\n\nBanks are required to classify non-performing assets further into the following three categories based on the period for which the asset has remained non-performing and the realisability of the dues:"

In case of cash credit / overdraft account, satisfactory performance means that the outstanding in the account shall not be more than the sanctioned limit or drawing power, whichever is lower, for a period of more than 30 days."

While accounts with aggregate exposure of ₹500 crores and above shall require two ratings, those below ₹500 crores shall require one rating. If the ratings are obtained from more than the required number of CRAs, all such ratings shall be investment grade for the account to qualify for an upgrade.\n\n17.2.2.3 If the borrower fails to demonstrate satisfactory performance during the monitoring period, asset classification upgrade shall be subject to implementation of a fresh restructuring/ change in ownership under Parts B1 and B2 of this Master Circular or under IBC. Lenders shall make an additional provision of 15% for such accounts at the end of the Review Period. This additional provision, along with other additional provisions, may be reversed as per the norms laid down at Paragraph 11.5.\n\n17.2.2.4 Provisions held on restructured assets may be reversed when the accounts are upgraded to standard category.\n\n17.2.2.5 Any default by the borrower in any of the credit facilities with any of the lenders (including any lender where the borrower is not in “specified period”) subsequent to upgrade in asset classification as above but before the end of the specified period, will require a fresh RP to be implemented within the above timelines as any default would entail. However, lenders shall make an additional provision of 15% for such accounts at the end of the Review Period. This additional provision, along with other additional provisions, may be reversed as per the norms laid down at Paragraph 11.5 of this Master Circular.\n\n“Specified period” means the period from the date of implementation of RP21 up to the date by which at least 20 per cent of the sum of outstanding principal debt as per the RP and interest capitalisation sanctioned as part of the restructuring, if any, is repaid.\n\n18. Provisioning Norms22\n\n18.1 Accounts restructured under the revised framework shall attract provisioning as per the asset classification category as laid out in part A of this Master Circular.\n\n18.2 In respect of accounts of debtors where a final RP, as approved by the Committee of Creditors, has been submitted by the Resolution Professional for approval of the Adjudicating Authority (in terms of section 30(6) of the IBC), lenders may keep the provisions held as on the date of such submission of RP frozen for a period of six months from the date of submission of the plan or up to 90 days from the date of approval of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority in terms of section 31 (1) of the IBC, whichever is earlier.\n\n18.3 The above facility of freezing the quantum of the provision shall be available only in cases where the provisioning held by the lenders as on the date of submission of the plan for approval of the Adjudicating Authority is more than the expected provisioning required to be held in the normal course upon implementation of the approved resolution plan, taking into account the contours of the resolution plan approved by Committee of Creditors/ Adjudicating Authority, as the case may be, and extant prudential norms. However, lenders shall not reverse the excess provisions held as on the date of submission of the resolution plan for approval of the Adjudicating Authority at this stage. In cases where the provisioning held is lower than the expected required provisioning, lenders shall make additional provisioning to the extent of the shortfall. Subsequent to the lapse of above mentioned period, provisioning shall be as per the norms laid out in Part A of this Master Circular. The facility of freezing of provisions shall also lapse immediately if the Adjudicating Authority rejects the resolution plan thus submitted. Asset classification in respect of such borrower shall continue be governed by the extant asset classification norms.\n\n18.4 MSME accounts restructured under the circulars DBR.No.BP.BC.18/21.04.048/2018-19 dated January 1, 2019 and DOR.No.BP.BC.34/21.04.048/2019-20 dated February 11, 2020 shall attract the provisioning requirements prescribed therein.\n\n19. Additional Finance\n\n19.1 Any additional finance approved under the RP (including any resolution plan approved by the Adjudicating Authority under IBC) may be treated as 'standard asset' during the monitoring period under the approved RP, provided the account demonstrates satisfactory performance (as defined at footnote 16) during the monitoring period. If the restructured asset fails to perform satisfactorily during the monitoring period or does not qualify for upgradation at the end of the monitoring period, the additional finance shall be placed in the same asset classification category as the restructured debt.\n\n19.2 Similarly, any interim finance [as defined in section 5 (15) of the IBC] extended by the lenders to debtors undergoing insolvency proceedings under IBC may be treated as ‘standard asset’ during the insolvency resolution process period as defined in the IBC. During this period, asset classification and provisioning for the interim finance shall be governed by the norms laid down in Part A of this Master Circular. Subsequently, upon approval of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority, treatment of such interim finance shall be as per the norms applicable to additional finance, as per Paragraph 19.1 above.\n\n20. Income recognition norms\n\n20.1 Interest income in respect of restructured accounts classified as 'standard assets' may be recognized on accrual basis and that in respect of the restructured accounts classified as 'non-performing assets' shall be recognised on cash basis.\n\n20.2 In the case of additional finance in accounts where the pre-restructuring facilities were classified as NPA, the interest income shall be recognised only on cash basis except when the restructuring is accompanied by a change in ownership.\n\n21. Conversion of Principal into Debt / Equity and Unpaid Interest into 'Funded Interest Term Loan' (FITL), Debt or Equity Instruments\n\n21.1 An act of restructuring might create new securities issued by the borrower which would be held by the lenders in lieu of a portion of the pre-restructured exposure. The FITL / debt / equity instruments created by conversion of principal / unpaid interest, as the case may be, shall be placed in the same asset classification category in which the restructured advance has been classified.\n\n21.2 The provisioning applicable to such instruments shall be the higher of:\n\n21.3 Debt/quasi-debt/equity instruments23 acquired by the lenders as part of a RP shall be valued as under:\n\na) Debentures/bonds shall be valued as per the instructions contained in paragraph 10 of the Master Direction - Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated August 25, 2021 (as amended from time to time).\n\nb) Conversion of debt into Zero Coupon Bonds (ZCBs)/low coupon bonds (LCBs) as part of RP shall be subject to the conditions prescribed in paragraph 12 of the Master Directions - Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated August 25, 2021 (as amended from time to time). Such ZCBs/LCBs shall be valued as per the instructions contained in Section 10 of the above said Master Direction, subject to the following:\n\nc) Equity instruments, where classified as standard, shall be valued at market value, if quoted, or else, should be valued at the lowest value arrived using the following valuation methodologies:\n\nd) Equity instruments, where classified as NPA, shall be valued at market value, if quoted, or else, shall be collectively valued at Re.1.\n\ne) Preference Shares shall be valued as per the instructions contained in paragraph 10 of the Master Direction - Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated August 25, 2021 (as amended from time to time), subject to the following modifications:\n\n21.4 The overarching principle should be that valuation of instruments arising out of resolution of stressed assets shall be based on conservative assessment of cash flows and appropriate discount rates to reflect the stressed cash flows of the borrowers. Statutory Auditors should also specifically examine as to whether the valuations of such instruments reflect the risk of loss associated with such instruments.\n\n21.5 In case lenders have acquired unquoted instruments on conversion of debt as a part of a RP, and if the RP is not deemed as implemented, such unquoted instruments shall collectively be valued at Re. 1 at that point, and till the RP is treated as implemented.\n\n21.6 The unrealised income represented by FITL / Debt or equity instrument should have a corresponding credit in an account styled as ';Sundry Liabilities Account (Interest Capitalization)';.\n\n21.7 The unrealised income represented by FITL / Debt or equity instrument can only be recognised in the profit and loss account as under:\n\n22. Change in Ownership\n\n22.1 In case of change in ownership of the borrowing entities, credit facilities of the concerned borrowing entities may be continued/upgraded as ‘standard’ after the change in ownership is implemented, either under the IBC or under this framework. If the change in ownership is implemented under this framework, then the classification as ‘standard’ shall be subject to the following conditions:\n\n22.2 Upon change in ownership, all the outstanding loans/credit facilities of the borrowing entity need to demonstrate satisfactory performance (as defined at footnote 18) during the monitoring period. If the account fails to perform satisfactorily at any point of time during the monitoring period, it shall trigger a fresh Review Period, in terms of Paragraph 9.1 above.\n\n22.3 The quantum of provisions held (excluding additional provisions) by the bank against the said account as on the date of change in ownership of the borrowing entities can be reversed only after the end of monitoring period subject to satisfactory performance during the same.\n\n23. Principles on classification of sale and lease back transactions as restructuring\n\n23.1 A sale and leaseback transaction of the assets of a borrower or other transactions of similar nature will be treated as an event of restructuring for the purpose of asset classification and provisioning in the books of lenders with regard to the residual debt of the seller as well as the debt of the buyer if all the following conditions are met:\n\n24. Prudential Norms relating to Refinancing of Exposures to Borrowers\n\nIf borrowings/export advances (denominated in any currency, wherever permitted) for the purpose of repayment/refinancing of loans denominated in same/another currency are obtained:\n\n25. Takeout Finance\n\nTakeout financing transactions that involve prior commitments shall be governed by the circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.144/21.04.048-2000 dated February 29, 2000 on “Income Recognition, Asset Classification, Provisioning and other related matters and Capital Adequacy Standards – Takeout Finance”.\n\n26. Regulatory Exemptions\n\n26.1 Exemptions from RBI Regulations\n\n26.1.1 Acquisition of non-SLR securities by way of conversion of debt is exempted from the restrictions and the prudential limit on investment in unlisted non-SLR securities prescribed by the RBI.\n\n26.1.2 Acquisition of shares due to conversion of debt to equity during a restructuring process will be exempted from regulatory ceilings/restrictions on Capital Market Exposures, investment in Para-Banking activities and intra-group exposure. However, these will require reporting to RBI (reporting to DoS, CO every month along with the regular DSB Return on Asset Quality) and disclosure by banks in the Notes to Accounts in Annual Financial Statements. Nonetheless, banks will have to comply with the provisions of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n\n26.2 Exemptions from Regulations of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\n\n26.2.1 SEBI has provided exemptions, under certain conditions, from the requirements of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) (ICDR) Regulations, 2018 for restructurings carried out as per the regulations issued by the Reserve Bank.\n\n26.2.2 With reference to the requirements contained in sub-regulations 158 (6) (a) of ICDR Regulations, 2018, the issue price of the equity shall be the lower of (a) or (b) below:\n\n26.2.3 In the case of conversion of debt into equity, the ‘reference date’ shall be the date on which the bank approves the restructuring scheme. In the case of conversion of convertible securities into equity, the ‘reference date’ shall be the date on which the bank approves the conversion of the convertible securities into equities.\n\n27. Restructuring of frauds/willful defaulters\n\nBorrowers who have committed frauds/ malfeasance/ willful default will remain ineligible for restructuring. However, in cases where the existing promoters are replaced by new promoters24, and the borrower company is totally delinked from such erstwhile promoters/management, lenders may take a view on restructuring such accounts based on their viability, without prejudice to the continuance of criminal action against the erstwhile promoters/management.\n\nPART C – Miscellaneous\n\n28. Wilful Defaulters and Non-Cooperative Borrowers\n\nInstructions regarding treatment of Wilful Defaulters are contained in our Master Circular DBR.No.CID.BC.57/20.16.003/2014-15 dated July 1, 2014 (updated up to January 7, 2015) on ‘Wilful Defaulters’ as updated from time to time. Banks are required to strictly adhere to these guidelines. In addition to these instructions and with a view to ensuring better corporate governance structure in companies and ensuring accountability of independent/professional directors, promoters, auditors, etc. henceforth, the following prudential measures will be applicable:\n\na) The provisioning in respect of existing loans/exposures of banks to companies having director/s (other than nominee directors of government/financial institutions brought on board at the time of distress), whose name/s appear more than once in the list of wilful defaulters, will be 5% in cases of standard accounts; if such account is classified as NPA, it will attract accelerated provisioning as under:\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\nb) This is a prudential measure since the expected losses on exposures to such borrowers are likely to be higher. It is reiterated that no additional facilities should be granted by any bank/FI to the listed wilful defaulters, in terms of Paragraph 2.5 (a) of Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters dated July 1, 2015.\n\nc) With a view to discouraging borrowers/defaulters from being unreasonable and non-cooperative with lenders in their bonafide resolution/recovery efforts, banks may classify such borrowers as non-cooperative borrowers25, after giving them due notice if satisfactory clarifications are not furnished. Banks will be required to report classification of such borrowers to CRILC. Detailed instructions in this regard have been issued vide circular DBR.No.CID.BC.54/20.16.064/2014-15 dated December 22, 2014 on Non-Cooperative Borrowers.\n\nd) Further, if any particular entity is reported as non-cooperative, any fresh exposure to such a borrower will, by implication, entail greater risk necessitating higher provisioning. Banks/FIs will therefore be required to make higher provisioning as applicable to substandard assets in respect of new loans sanctioned to such borrowers as also new loans sanctioned to any other company that has on its board of directors any of the whole time directors/promoters of a non-cooperative borrowing company or any firm in which such a non-cooperative borrower is in charge of management of the affairs. However, for the purpose of asset classification and income recognition, the new loans would be treated as standard assets. This is a prudential measure since the expected losses on exposures on exposures to such non-cooperative borrowers are likely to be higher.\n\n29. Dissemination of Information\n\n29.1 At present, the list of suit filed accounts and non-suit filed accounts of Wilful Defaulters (₹25 lakh and above) is submitted by banks to the Credit Information Companies (CICs) of which they are member(s), who display the same on their respective websites as and when received. In order to make the current system of banks/FIs reporting names of suit filed accounts and non-suit filed accounts of Wilful Defaulters and its availability to the banks by CICs as current as possible, banks are advised to forward data on wilful defaulters to the CICs at the earliest but not later than a month from the reporting date and they must use/ furnish the detailed information as per the format prescribed in our Master Circular DBR.No.CID.BC.57/20.16.003/2014-15 dated July 1, 2015 on ‘Wilful Defaulters’, as updated from time to time.\n\n29.2 In terms of our Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters mentioned above, in case any falsification of accounts on the part of the borrowers is observed by the banks / FIs, and if it is observed that the auditors were negligent or deficient in conducting the audit, banks should lodge a formal complaint against the auditors of the borrowers with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to enable the ICAI to examine and fix accountability of the auditors. RBI reiterates these instructions for strict compliance. Pending disciplinary action by ICAI, the complaints may also be forwarded to the RBI (Department of Banking Supervision, Central Office) and IBA for records. IBA would circulate the names of the CA firms against whom many complaints have been received amongst all banks who should consider this aspect before assigning any work to them. RBI would also share such information with other financial sector regulators/Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)/Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).\n\n29.3 Further, banks may seek explanation from advocates who wrongly certify as to clear legal titles in respect of assets or valuers who overstate the security value, by negligence or connivance, and if no reply/satisfactory clarification is received from them within one month, they may report their names to IBA. The IBA may circulate the names of such advocates/valuers among its members for consideration before availing of their services in future. The IBA would create a central registry for this purpose.\n\n30. Bank Loans for Financing Promoters’ Contribution\n\n30.1 In terms of extant instructions on Bank Loans for Financing Promoters Contribution as consolidated in our Master Circular DBOD.No.Dir.BC.16/13.03.00/2014-15 dated July 1, 2015 on ‘Loans and Advances – Statutory and Other Restrictions’, the promoters' contribution towards the equity capital of a company should come from their own resources and banks should not normally grant advances to take up shares of other companies.\n\n30.2 It has been decided that banks can extend finance to ‘specialized’ entities established for acquisition of troubled companies subject to the general guidelines applicable to advances against shares/debentures/bonds as contained in the above-mentioned Master Circular and other regulatory and statutory exposure limits. The lenders should, however, assess the risks associated with such financing and ensure that these entities are adequately capitalized, and debt equity ratio for such entity is not more than 3:1.\n\n30.3 In this connection, a ‘specialized’ entity will be a body corporate exclusively set up for the purpose of taking over and turning around troubled companies and promoted by individuals or/and institutional promoters (including Government) having professional expertise in turning around ‘troubled companies’ and eligible to make investments in the industry/segment to which the target asset belonged.\n\n31. Credit Risk Management\n\n31.1 Banks are advised that they should strictly follow the credit risk management guidelines contained in our circular DBOD.No.BP.(SC).BC.98/21.04.103/99 dated October 7, 1999 on ‘Risk Management Systems in Banks’, and DBOD.No.BP.520/21.04.103/2002-03 dated October 12, 2002 on ‘Guidance Notes on Management of Credit Risk and Market Risk’\n\n31.2 It is reiterated that lenders should carry out their independent and objective credit appraisal in all cases and must not depend on credit appraisal reports prepared by outside consultants, especially the in-house consultants of the borrowing entity.\n\n31.3 Banks/lenders should carry out sensitivity tests/scenario analysis, especially for infrastructure projects, which should inter alia include project delays and cost overruns. This will aid in taking a view on viability of the project at the time of deciding on deferment of DCCO/restructuring.\n\n31.4 Lenders should ascertain the source and quality of equity capital brought in by the promoters /shareholders. Multiple leveraging, especially, in infrastructure projects, is a matter of concern as it effectively camouflages the financial ratios such as Debt/Equity ratio, leading to adverse selection of the borrowers. Therefore, lenders should ensure at the time of credit appraisal that debt of the parent company is not infused as equity capital of the subsidiary/SPV.\n\n31.5 Ministry of Corporate Affairs had introduced the concept of a Director Identification Number (DIN) with the insertion of Sections 266A to 266G of Companies (Amendment) Act, 2006. Further, in terms of Paragraph 5.4 of our Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters dated July 1, 2015, in order to ensure that directors are correctly identified and in no case, persons whose names appear to be similar to the names of directors appearing in the list of wilful defaulters, are wrongfully denied credit facilities on such grounds, banks/FIs have been advised to include the Director Identification Number (DIN) as one of the fields in the data submitted by them to Reserve Bank of India/Credit Information Companies.\n\n31.6 It is reiterated that while carrying out the credit appraisal, banks should verify as to whether the names of any of the directors of the companies appear in the list of defaulters/ wilful defaulters by way of reference to DIN/PAN etc. Further, in case of any doubt arising on account of identical names, banks should use independent sources for confirmation of the identity of directors rather than seeking declaration from the borrowing company.\n\n31.7 Paragraph 2.7 of the Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters states that, “with a view to monitoring the end-use of funds, if the lenders desire a specific certification from the borrowers’ auditors regarding diversion / siphoning of funds by the borrower, the lender should award a separate mandate to the auditors for the purpose. To facilitate such certification by the auditors the banks and FIs will also need to ensure that appropriate covenants in the loan agreements are incorporated to enable award of such a mandate by the lenders to the borrowers / auditors”.\n\n31.8 In addition to the above, banks are advised that with a view to ensuring proper end-use of funds and preventing diversion/siphoning of funds by the borrowers, lenders could consider engaging their own auditors for such specific certification purpose without relying on certification given by borrower’s auditors. However, this cannot substitute bank’s basic minimum own diligence in the matter.\n\n31.9 Banks shall review their extant sectoral exposure limits for consumer credit and put in place, if not already there, Board approved limits in respect of various sub-segments under consumer credit as may be considered necessary by the Boards as part of prudent risk management. In particular, limits shall be prescribed for all unsecured consumer credit exposures. The limits so fixed shall be strictly adhered to and monitored on an ongoing basis by the Risk Management Committee.26\n\n32. Registration of Transactions with CERSAI\n\nIn terms of circular DBOD.Leg.No.BC.86/09.08.011/2010-11 dated April 21, 2011 on ‘Setting up of Central Electronic Registry under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act 2002’, as amended from time to time, banks are required to register, on an ongoing basis, the transactions relating to securitization and reconstruction of financial assets on the CERSAI portal. Banks also need to file, on an ongoing basis, the following types of security interest on the CERSAI portal to secure any loans or advances:\n\n33. Board Oversight\n\n33.1 The Board of Directors of banks should take all necessary steps to arrest the deteriorating asset quality in their books and should focus on improving the credit risk management system. Early recognition of problems in asset quality and resolution envisaged in these guidelines requires the lenders to be proactive and make use of CRILC.\n\n33.2 The boards of banks should put in place a system for proper and timely classification of borrowers as wilful defaulters or/and non-cooperative borrowers. Further, Boards of banks should periodically review the accounts classified as such, say on a half yearly basis.\n\n34. Specification of due date/repayment date\n\nThe exact due dates for repayment of a loan, frequency of repayment, breakup between principal and interest, examples of SMA/NPA classification dates, etc. shall be clearly specified in the loan agreement and the borrower shall be apprised of the same at the time of loan sanction and also at the time of subsequent changes, if any, to the sanction terms/loan agreement till full repayment of the loan. In cases of loan facilities with moratorium on payment of principal and/or interest, the exact date of commencement of repayment shall also be specified in the loan agreements. These instructions shall be complied with at the earliest, but not later than December 31, 2021, in respect of fresh loans. In case of existing loans, however, compliance to these instructions shall necessarily be ensured as and when such loans become due for renewal/review.\n\n35. Consumer Education\n\nWith a view to increasing awareness among the borrowers, banks shall place consumer education literature on their websites, explaining with examples, the concepts of date of overdue, SMA and NPA classification and upgradation, with specific reference to day-end process. Banks may also consider displaying such consumer education literature in their branches by means of posters and/or other appropriate media. Further, it shall also be ensured that their front-line officers educate borrowers about all these concepts, with respect to loans availed by them, at the time of sanction/disbursal/renewal of loans.\n\nPART D - ANNEXES\n\nAnnex - 1\n\nDetails of Gross Advances, Gross NPAs, Net Advances and Net NPAs"

Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks);b. All India Term Financial Institutions (NABARD, NHB, EXIM Bank, and SIDBI);c. Small Finance Banks; and,d. Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC-ND-SI) and Deposit taking Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC-D).\n\n6 ‘Default’ means non-payment of debt (as defined under the IBC) when whole or any part or instalment of the debt has become due and payable and is not paid by the debtor or the corporate debtor, as the case may be.      For revolving facilities like cash credit, default would also mean, without prejudice to the above, the outstanding balance remaining continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit or drawing power, whichever is lower, for more than 30 days.\n\n7 Aggregate exposure under the guidelines would include all fund based and non-fund based exposure, including investment exposure with the lenders.\n\n8 In cases where asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) have exposure to the borrower concerned, they shall also sign the ICA and adhere to all its provisions.\n\n9 Liquidation value would mean the estimated realisable value of the assets of the relevant borrower, if such borrower were to be liquidated as on the date of commencement of the Review Period.\n\n10 Restructuring is an act in which a lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, grants concessions to the borrower. Restructuring would normally involve modification of terms of the advances / securities, which would generally include, among others, alteration of payment period / payable amount / the amount of instalments / rate of interest; roll over of credit facilities; sanction of additional credit facility/ release of additional funds for an account in default to aid curing of default / enhancement of existing credit limits; compromise settlements where time for payment of settlement amount exceeds three months.\n\n11 The residual debt of the borrower entity, in this context, means the aggregate debt (fund based as well as non-fund based) envisaged to be held by all the lenders as per the proposed RP.\n\n12 Annex – 4 provides list of RP symbols that can be provided by CRAs as ICE and their meanings.\n\n13 During the period when the RP is being finalised and implemented, the usual asset classification norms would continue to apply subject to additional provisioning requirements of this circular. The process of re-classification of an asset should not stop merely because RP is under consideration.\n\n14 This may be in addition to direction to bank/s to file insolvency application under the IBC.\n\n15 Please refer to the Framework for Compromise Settlements and Technical Write-offs dated June 8, 2023 and FAQs on the same issued on June 20, 2023.\n\n16 Based on the Basel Committee Guidelines on “Prudential treatment of problem assets – definitions of non-performing exposures and forbearance”.\n\n17 Applicable to all resolution plans, including those undertaken under IBC.\n\n18 Satisfactory performance means that the borrower entity is not in default at any point of time during the period concerned.\n\n19 Outstanding principal debt shall include all credit facilities, including debt/debt like instruments (viz., non-convertible debentures, optionally convertible debentures, optionally convertible preference shares, non-convertible preference shares etc.) that exist post implementation of the RP. Only equity and instruments compulsorily convertible into equity (without any embedded optionality) shall be exempt from determining outstanding principal debt.\n\n20 These ratings shall be the normal ratings provided by the CRAs and not ICEs referred to in paragraph 10.1 of this Master Circular.\n\n21 For accounts restructured under IBC, the specified period shall be deemed to commence from the date of implementation of the resolution plan as approved by the Adjudicating Authority\n\n22 Additional provisions for delayed implementation of RP within timelines shall be as per paragraphs 11.1 – 11.4 of this Master Circular\n\n23 These instruments shall be subject to all the instructions contained in Master Direction - Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated August 25, 2021 (as amended from time to time) to the extent they are not inconsistent with the instructions contained in this circular.\n\n24 New promoters must satisfy the conditions specified at paragraph 22.1 (a), (b) and (c) above.\n\n25 A non-cooperative borrower is one who does not engage constructively with his lender by defaulting in timely repayment of dues while having ability to pay, thwarting lenders’ efforts for recovery of their dues by not providing necessary information sought, denying access to assets financed / collateral securities, obstructing sale of securities, etc. In effect, a non-cooperative borrower is a defaulter who deliberately stone walls legitimate efforts of the lenders to recover their dues.\n\n26 Please refer to Para 2.C.(a) of Regulatory measures towards consumer credit and bank credit to NBFCs dated November 16, 2023."

The loan could, however, supplement budgetary resources if such supplementing was contemplated in the project design. Thus, in the case of a housing project, where the project is run on commercial lines, and the Government is interested in promoting the project either for the benefit of the weaker sections of the society or otherwise, and a part of the project cost is met by the Government through subsidies made available and/or contributions to the capital of the institutions taking up the project, the bank finance should be restricted to an amount arrived at after reducing from the total project cost the amount of subsidy/capital contribution receivable from the Government and any other resources proposed to be made available by the Government.\n\n(c) Banks had, in the past, sanctioned term loans to Corporations set up by Government like State Police Housing Corporation, for construction of residential quarters for allotment to employees where the loans were envisaged to be repaid out of budgetary allocations. As these projects cannot be considered to be run on commercial lines, it would not be in order for banks to grant loans to such projects."

These loans products are popularly known by various names like 80:20, 75:25 schemes.\n\n(b) Such housing loan products are likely to expose the banks as well as their home loan borrowers to additional risks e.g., in case of dispute between individual borrowers and developers/builders, default/ delayed payment of interest/ EMI by the developer/ builder during the agreed period on behalf of the borrower, non-completion of the project on time etc. Further, any delayed payments by developers/ builders on behalf of individual borrowers to banks may lead to lower credit rating/ scoring of such borrowers by credit information companies (CICs) as information about servicing of loans get passed on to the CICs on a regular basis. In cases, where bank loans are also disbursed upfront on behalf of their individual borrowers in a lump-sum to builders/ developers without any linkage to stages of constructions, banks run disproportionately higher exposures with concomitant risks of diversion of funds.\n\n(c) Disbursal of housing loans sanctioned to individuals should be closely linked to the stages of construction of the housing project / houses and upfront disbursal should not be made in cases of incomplete / under-construction / green field housing projects.\n\n(d) However, in cases of projects sponsored by Government/Statutory Authorities, banks may disburse the loans as per the payment stages prescribed by such authorities, even where payments sought from house buyers are not linked to the stages of constructions, provided such authorities have no past history of non-completion of projects.\n\n(e) It is emphasized that banks while introducing any kind of product should take into account the customer suitability and appropriateness issues and also ensure that the borrowers/ customers are made fully aware of the risks and liabilities under such products."

These banks, with their vast network, occupy a very strategic position in the financial system and have an important role to play in providing credit to the housing sector. Further, housing finance to specified categories up to prescribed limits is treated as priority sector lending, and the need for UCBs providing credit to priority sector has come to be increasingly recognised consistent with the social objectives placed before the banking system.\n\n1.2 Therefore, with a view to enabling the UCBs to play a more positive role in providing finance for housing schemes, particularly to the weaker sections of the community, these banks are permitted to grant loans for housing schemes up to certain limits from their own resources subject to the guidelines detailed hereunder.\n\n1.3 Bigger banks that have large surplus resources may undertake larger lending for housing, as this will provide a remunerative avenue for investment of their surplus funds.\n\n1.4 Wherever banks are still required to obtain special permission of the Registrar for financing housing societies, it is suggested that these banks should obtain general permission to finance housing societies subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed for the purpose."

For reckoning total assets, losses, intangible assets, contra items like bills receivables etc. would be excluded.\n\n4.7.3 The exposure should take into account both fund based and non-fund based facilities.\n\n4.7.4 Working capital loans given by UCBs against hypothecation of construction materials provided to the contractors who undertake comparatively small construction on their own without receiving advance payments as provided for in paragraph 7 of this circular is exempted from the prescribed limit.\n\n4.7.5 Finance extended to the eligible category of borrowers mentioned in paragraph 2 above will only be eligible to be treated as housing finance. While the purpose of the loan shall determine whether the loans granted against the security of immovable property need to be classified as real estate loans, the source of repayment will determine whether the exposure is against commercial real estate. For classification of such loans as Real Estate / Commercial Real Estate, UCBs may be guided by the instructions contained in Annex 1. As loans to the residential housing projects under the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Sector exhibit lesser risk and volatility than the CRE Sector taken as a whole, a separate sub-sector called ‘Commercial Real Estate–Residential Housing’ (CRE-RH) has been carved out from the CRE Sector. CRE-RH would consist of loans to builders/developers for residential housing projects (except for captive consumption) under CRE segment. Such projects should ordinarily not include non-residential commercial real estate. However, integrated housing projects comprising some commercial space (e.g. shopping complex, school, etc.) can also be classified under CRE-RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project does not exceed 10% of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10%, the project loans should be classified as CRE and not CRE-RH.\n\n4.7.6 UCBs shall not exceed the limit prescribed for grant of housing, real estate, commercial real estate loans even for the funds obtained from higher financing agencies and refinance from National Housing Bank."

                "content": "7.1 Builders / contractors generally require huge funds, take advance payments from the prospective buyers or from those on whose behalf construction is undertaken and, therefore, may not normally require bank finance for the purpose. Any financial assistance extended to them by UCBs may result in dual financing. Banks should, therefore, normally refrain from sanctioning loans and advances to this category of borrowers.\n\n7.2 However, where contractors undertake comparatively small construction work on their own, (i.e., when no advance payments are received by them for the purpose), banks may consider extending financial assistance to them against the hypothecation of construction materials, provided such loans and advances are in accordance with the bye laws of the bank and instructions / directives issued by the Reserve Bank from time to time.\n\n7.3 Banks should undertake a proper scrutiny of the relevant loan applications, and satisfy themselves, among other things, about the genuineness of the purpose, the quantum of financial assistance required, creditworthiness of the borrower, repayment capacity, etc. and also observe the usual safeguards, such as, obtaining periodic stock statements, carrying out periodic inspections, determining drawing power strictly on the basis of the stock held, maintaining a margin of not less than 40 to 50 percent, etc. They should also ensure that materials used up in the construction work are not included in the stock statements for the purpose of determining the drawing power.\n\n7.4 Valuation of land: It has been observed that while financing builders / contractors, certain banks valued the land for the purpose of security, on the basis of the discounted value of the property after it is developed, less the cost of development. This is not in conformity with established norms. In this connection, it is clarified that UCBs should not extend fund based / non-fund based facilities to builders / contractors for acquisition of land even as a part of a housing project. Further, wherever land is accepted as collateral, valuation of such land should be at the current market price only.\n\n7.5 UCBs may also take collateral security, wherever available. As construction work progresses, contractors will get paid and such payments should be applied to reduce the balance in the borrowal accounts. If possible, banks could perhaps enter into a tripartite agreement with the borrower and his clients, particularly when no collateral securities are available for such advances.\n\n7.6 It has been observed that some banks have introduced certain innovative Housing Loan Schemes in association with developers / builders, e.g., upfront disbursal of sanctioned individual housing loans to builders without linking the disbursals to various stages of construction of housing project, interest / EMI on the housing loan availed of by the individual borrower being serviced by the builders during the construction period / specified period, etc. In view of the higher risks associated with such lump-sum disbursal of sanctioned housing loans and customer suitability issues, UCBs are advised that disbursal of housing loans sanctioned to individuals should be closely linked to the stages of construction of the housing project / houses and upfront disbursal should not be made in cases of incomplete / under-construction / green field housing projects."

Similarly, the salary certificates of employees of certain public sector undertakings were fabricated, so as to match the requirement of banks for availing higher amounts of loan. The estimates given were also on the higher side, so as to avoid contribution of margin money by the borrowers.\n\nSuch frauds could take place on account of laxity on the part of the bank officials to follow the laid down procedures for verifying the genuineness of the documents submitted by borrowers independently through their own advocates / solicitors. Banks should, therefore, take due precaution while accepting various documents.\n\n9.2 Banks shall satisfy themselves that loans extended by them are not for unauthorized construction or for misuse of properties / encroachment on public land. For this purpose, they should ensure strict compliance with the procedure laid down in Annex 2.\n\n9.3 In a case which came up before the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay, the Hon'ble Court observed that the bank granting finance to housing / development projects should insist on disclosure of the charge / or any other liability on the plot, in the brochure, pamphlets etc., which may be published by developer / owner inviting public at large to purchase flats and properties. The Court also added that this obviously would be part of the terms and conditions on which the loan may be sanctioned by the bank. Keeping in view the above observations, while granting finance for eligible housing schemes, UCBs are advised to stipulate as part of terms and conditions that:\n\n(a) The builder / developer shall disclose in the pamphlets / brochures etc., the name(s) of the bank(s) to which the property is mortgaged.\n\n(b) The builder / developer would append the information relating to mortgage while advertising for a particular scheme in newspapers / magazines etc.\n\n(c) The builder / developer would indicate in the pamphlets / brochures that he would provide No Objection Certificate (NOC) / permission of the mortgagee bank for sale of flats / property, if required. UCBs are advised to ensure compliance of the above terms and conditions. Funds should not be released unless the builder / developer fulfils the above requirements."

                "content": "(vide paragraph 4.7.5)\n\nReal Estate is generally defined as an immovable asset - land (earth space) and the permanently attached improvements to it. Income-producing real estate (IPRE) is defined in para 226 of the Basel II Framework as under:\n\n';Income-producing real estate (IPRE) refers to a method of providing funding to real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset. The borrower may be, but is not required to be, an SPE (Special Purpose Entity), an operating company focused on real estate construction or holdings, or an operating company with sources of revenue other than real estate. The distinguishing characteristic of IPRE versus other corporate exposures that are collateralised by real estate is the strong positive correlation between the prospects for repayment of the exposure and the prospects for recovery in the event of default, with both depending primarily on the cash flows generated by a property';.\n\n2. The Income Producing Real Estate (IPRE) is synonymous with Commercial Real Estate (CRE). From the definition of IPRE given above, it may be seen that for an exposure to be classified as IPRE / CRE, the essential feature would be that the funding will result in the creation / acquisition of real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment would depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. Additionally, the prospect of recovery in the event of default would also depend primarily on the cash flows generated from such funded asset which is taken as security, as would generally be the case. The primary source of cash flow (i.e., more than 50% of cash flows) for repayment would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the assets as also for recovery in the event of default where such asset is taken as security.\n\n3. In certain cases where the exposure may not be directly linked to the creation or acquisition of CRE, but the repayment would come from the cash flows generated by CRE. For example, exposures taken against existing commercial real estate whose prospects of repayments primarily depend on rental / sale proceeds of the real estate should be classified as CRE. Other such cases may include extension of guarantees on behalf of companies engaged in commercial real estate activities, corporate loans extended to real estate companies etc.\n\n4. It follows from the definition at para 2 and 3 above that if the repayment primarily depends on other factors such as operating profit from business operations, quality of goods and services, tourist arrivals etc., the exposure would not be counted as Commercial Real Estate.\n\n5. UCBs should not extend finance for acquisition of land even if it is part of a project. However, finance can be granted to individuals for purchase of a plot, provided a declaration is obtained from the borrower that he intends to construct a house on the said plot, within such period as may be laid down by the banks themselves."

                "content": "6. It is possible for an exposure to get classified simultaneously into more than one category, real estate, CRE, infrastructure etc. as different classifications are driven by different considerations. In such cases, the exposure would be reckoned for regulatory / prudential exposure limit, if any, fixed by RBI or by the bank itself, for all the categories to which the exposure is assigned. For the purpose of capital adequacy, the largest of the risk weights applicable among all the categories would be applicable for the exposure. The rationale for such an approach is that, while at times certain classifications / categorizations could be driven by socio-economic considerations and may be aimed at encouraging flow of credit towards certain activities, these exposures should be subjected to appropriate risk management / prudential / capital adequacy norms so as to address the risk inherent in them. Similarly, if an exposure has sensitivity to more than one risk factor it should be subjected to the risk management framework applicable to all the relevant risk factors.\n\n7. In order to assist banks in determining as to whether a particular exposure should be classified as CRE or not, some examples based on the principles described above are given below. Based on the above principles and illustrations given, banks should be able to determine, whether an exposure not included in the illustrative examples is a CRE or not and should record a reasoned note justifying the classification."

                "content": "1. Loans extended to builders for construction of any property which is intended to be sold or given on lease (e.g., loans extended to builders for housing buildings, hotels, restaurants, gymnasiums, hospitals, condominiums, shopping malls, office blocks, theatres, amusement parks, cold storages, warehouses, educational institutions, industrial parks). In such cases, the source of repayment in normal course would be the cash flows generated by the sale / lease rentals of the property. In case of default of the loan, the recovery will also be made from sale of the property if the exposure is secured by these assets as would generally be the case.\n\n2. Loans for Multiple Houses intended to be rented out\n\nThe housing loans extended in cases where houses are rented out need to be treated differently. If the total number of such units is more than two, the exposure for the third unit onwards may be treated as CRE exposure as the borrower may be renting these housing units and the rental income would be the primary source of repayment.\n\n3. Loans for Integrated Township Projects\n\nWhere the CRE is part of a big project which has small non-CRE component, it will be classified as CRE exposure since the primary source of repayment for such exposures would be the sale proceeds of buildings meant for sale.\n\n4. Exposures to Real Estate Companies\n\nIn some cases, exposure to real estate companies is not directly linked to the creation or acquisition of CRE, but the repayment would come from the cash flows generated by Commercial Real Estate. Such exposures illustratively could be :\n\n5. General Purpose loans where repayment is dependent on real estate prices\n\nExposures intended to be repaid out of rentals / sale proceeds generated by the existing CRE owned by the borrower, where the finance may have been extended for a general purpose."

                "title": "B. Exposures which may not be classified as CRE",
                "content": "1. Exposures to entrepreneurs for acquiring real estate for the purpose of their carrying on business activities, which would be serviced out of the cash flows generated by those business activities. The exposure could be secured by the real estate where the activity is carried out, as would generally be the case, or could even be unsecured.\n\na. Loans extended for construction of a cinema theatre, establishment of an amusement park, hotels and hospitals, cold storages, warehouses, educational institutions, running haircutting saloons and beauty parlours, restaurant, gymnasium etc. to those entrepreneurs who themselves run these ventures would fall in this category. Such loans would generally be secured by these properties.\n\nFor instance, in the case of hotels and hospitals, the source of repayment in normal course would be the cash flows generated by the services rendered by the hotel and hospital. In the case of a hotel, the cash flows would be mainly sensitive to the factors influencing the flow of tourism, not directly to the fluctuations in the real estate prices. In the case of a hospital, the cash flows in normal course would be sensitive to the quality of doctors and other diagnostic services provided by the hospital. In these cases, the source of repayment might also depend to some extent upon the real estate prices to the extent the fluctuation in prices influence the room rents, but it will be a minor factor in determining the overall cash flows. In these cases, however, the recovery in case of default, if the exposure is secured by the Commercial Real Estate, would depend upon the sale price of the hotel / hospital as well as upon the maintenance and quality of equipment and furnishings.\n\nThe above principle will also be applicable in the cases where the developers / owners of the real estate assets (hotels, hospitals, warehouses, etc.) lease out the assets on revenue sharing or profit sharing arrangement and the repayment of exposure depends upon the cash flows generated by the services rendered, instead of fixed lease rentals.\n\nb. Loans extended to entrepreneurs, for setting up industrial units will also fall in this category. In such cases, the repayment would be made from the cash flows generated by the industrial unit from sale of the material produced which would mainly depend upon demand and supply factors. The recovery in case of default may partly depend upon the sale of land and building if secured by these assets.\n\nThus, it may be seen that in these cases the real estate prices do not affect repayment though recovery of the loan could partly be from sale of real estate.\n\n2. Loans extended to a company for a specific purpose, not linked to a real estate activity, which is engaged in mixed activities including real estate activity.\n\nFor instance, a company has two divisions. One division is engaged in real estate activity, and other division is engaged in power production. An infrastructure loan, for setting up of a power plant extended to such a company, to be repaid by the sale of electricity would not be classified as CRE. The exposure may or may not be secured by plant and machinery.\n\n3. Loans extended against the Security of future rent receivables\n\nA few banks have formulated schemes where the owners of existing real estate such as shopping malls, office premises, etc. have been offered finance to be repaid out of the rentals generated by these properties. Even though such exposures do not result in funding / acquisition of commercial real estate, the repayment might be sensitive to fall in real estate rentals and such exposures should be classified as CRE. However, if there are certain in built safety conditions which have the effect of delinking the repayments from real estate price volatility like, the lease rental agreement between the lessor and lessee has a lock in period which is not shorter than the tenor of loan and there is no clause which allows a downward revision in the rentals during the period covered by the loan banks can classify such exposures as non CRE. Banks may, however, record a reasoned note in all such cases.\n\n4. Credit facilities provided to construction companies which work as Contractors\n\nThe working capital facilities extended to construction companies working as contractors, rather than builders, will not be treated as CRE exposures because the repayment would depend upon the contractual payments received in accordance with the progress in completion of work.\n\n5. Financing of acquisition / renovation of self-owned office / company premises\n\nSuch exposures will not be treated as CRE exposures because the repayment will come from company revenues. The exposures to industrial units towards setting up of units or projects and working capital requirement, etc. would not be treated as CRE exposures."

The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the Central and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the agency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual agreement. RBI pays agency commission to the agency banks for the government business handled by them. This Master Circular consolidates the instructions contained in the circulars listed in Annex 1."

                "content": "2. Transactions relating to the following government business undertaken by agency banks are eligible for agency commission paid by RBI:\n\n3. The Agency banks also undertake the work related to Small Savings Schemes (SSS) the commission for which is borne by Government of India. Though the settlement of commission on such SSS is processed by RBI and settled at Central Accounts Section (CAS), Nagpur, the rates of agency commission related to SSS transactions are decided by Government of India. Agency commission claims on Special Deposit Scheme (SDS) related transactions (where mirror accounts are maintained in RBI) are also settled at CAS, Nagpur.\n\n4. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from financial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commission as these transactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business. Reserve Bank pays the agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for acting as agents for management of public debt.\n\n5. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical mode or e-mode (challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the agency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive remuneration from the State Government for doing this work.\n\n6. If the agency bank is engaged by the State Government as Franking Vendor and it collects stamp duty from the public for franking the documents, it will not be eligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to it as Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects the stamp duty paid by the Franking Vendor for credit to the Treasury through challan in physical or e-mode for purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since it is a regular payment of Stamp Duty as stated above."

                "content": "7. Agency banks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or through authorised branches of any other agency bank including State Bank of India or offices of Reserve Bank of India wherever they do not have their own authorised direct tax collection branch should indicate the same separately in the scroll. Such transactions will not be eligible for payment of agency commission. Banks should furnish a certificate to the effect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) paid by them have been excluded while claiming agency commission.\n\n8. The following activities, inter alia, do not come under the purview of agency bank business and are therefore not eligible for payment of agency commission.\n\n9. Agency Banks are advised to meticulously follow instructions issued by RBI from time to time regarding transactions which are not eligible for agency commission and submit their claims for agency commission accordingly. All agency banks while claiming agency commission should certify that no claim of agency commission is made on ineligible transactions.\n\n10. Reporting of transactions by agency banks to RBI: After the operationalisation of NEFT 24X7 and RTGS 24X7, agency banks authorised to collect Goods and Service Tax (GST) and Direct Taxes under TIN 2.0 channel shall upload their luggage files in RBI’s QPX/e-Kuber on all days except the Global holidays, which are January 26, August 15, October 2, all non-working Saturdays, all Sundays and any other day declared holiday by RBI for Government Transactions due to exigencies. It is to be ensured that these luggage files are uploaded in RBI’s QPX/e-Kuber on or before 1800 hours prescribed by Office of Principal Chief Controller of Accounts, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs and Office of Principal Chief Controller of Accounts, Central Board of Direct Taxes. No extension in cut-off time will be allowed to agency banks by RBI beyond 1800 hours for uploading of these luggage files in QPX/e-Kuber.\n\n11. State government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) of previous month reported after 8th of the succeeding month and those pertaining to earlier months should be reported to RBI through a separate statement for accounting, after being confirmed by the competent authorities of concerned State government.\n\n12. For Central Government transactions (electronic as well as in physical mode) or any adjustments thereof, if reported after a gap of 90 days from the date of transaction, agency banks have to obtain prior approval from concerned ministry/department and submit the same to RBI separately at the time of reporting such transactions for settlement."

                "title": "Rates for agency commission",
                "content": "13. As per agency bank agreement, RBI pays agency commission at rates determined by it. The rates applicable with effect from July 1, 2019 are as under:\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\n14. In this context, the ‘Receipts-e-mode transactions’ indicated against Sr. No. a.(ii) in the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from the remitter’s bank account through Internet banking as well as such transactions which do not involve physical receipt of cash /instruments at all. For example, challan generated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with cash / instrument should be treated as transaction under physical mode.\n\n15. With reference to the implementation of GST regime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number (CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This means that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records clubbed under a single challan i.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission effective July 1, 2017.\n\n16. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that a single challan (electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only and not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts that will get credited. Therefore, records clubbed under a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission.\n\n17. Agency banks would be eligible to claim agency commission for pension transactions at the rate of ₹75 per transaction only when the entire work relating to disbursement of pension including pension calculation is attended to by them. If the work relating to pension calculations etc. is attended to by the concerned Government Department / Treasury and the banks are required only to credit the amount of pension to the pensioners' accounts maintained with them by a single debit to Government Account, such transaction is to be categorised under ‘other than pension payment’ and would be eligible for payment of agency commission @ 6.5 paise per ₹ 100/- turnover w.e.f. July 1, 2019.\n\n18. The number of transactions eligible for payment of agency commission should not exceed 14 per pensioner per year. This includes one monthly credit for payment of net pension and a maximum of two per year for payment of arrears on account of increase in dearness relief, if applicable. Cases involving payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension qualifies as a single transaction for claiming of agency commission. In other words, any payment of arrears on account of late start/restart of pension should be treated as a single credit transaction and not as separate monthly credits.\n\n19. Agency commission is payable to an agency bank at the full rate provided the transactions are handled by the bank at all stages. Where, however, the work is shared between two banks, the agency commission is shared between the banks in the proportion of 75:25. Thus, broadly, the agency commission is payable to the agency banks as detailed below:\n\n20. All agency banks should settle their agency transactions for both funds and agency commission directly with the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank instead of routing them through any other agency bank that acts as aggregator in certain cases. So also for payments made by all agency banks on behalf of State government/s get directly settled with the concerned Regional Office of RBI. Agency Transaction details/scrolls may be sent directly by individual agency bank to the concerned State Government/Treasury. This new arrangement for settlement of State government funds on day to day basis (receipts and payments) directly with Reserve Bank is with effect from January 1, 2018."

                "content": "21. Agency banks are required to submit their claims for agency commission in the prescribed format (with GST details) to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions and the respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for State government transactions. However, agency commission claims with respect to GST receipt and transactions related to direct tax collection under TIN 2.0 regime, and transactions pertaining to collection of indirect taxes through ICEGATE payment gateway reported to Mumbai Regional Office, RBI will be settled at Mumbai Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India only and accordingly all agency banks, authorized to collect GST and direct tax collection under TIN 2.0 and indirect taxes through ICEGATE payment gateway, are advised to submit their agency commission claims pertaining to the respective receipt transactions at Mumbai Regional Office only. The agency commission claim for Central Government transactions reported to CAS, Nagpur, RBI will be continued to be settled at CAS, Nagpur, RBI. The formats for claiming agency commission for all agency banks and separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the branch officials and Chartered Accountants or Cost Accountants are given in Annex 2, Annex 2A and Annex 2B respectively. These certificates would be in addition to the usual Certificate from ED / CGM (in charge of government business) to the effect that there are no pension arrears to be credited / delays in crediting regular pension / arrears thereof.\n\n22. Where the External Auditor is also the Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor, claims can be certified by such Concurrent Auditor / Statutory Auditor. In addition to this, agency banks are required to ensure that the agency bank’s internal inspectors / auditors verify the agency commission claims submitted by their branches and confirm their accuracy during the course of their inspection / audit.\n\n23. Reference is also drawn to the instructions contained in our letter dated November 4, 2016 advising the process of claiming reimbursement of service tax (ST) on agency commission received for Central and State Government transactions, centrally from Reserve Bank of India at Central Accounts Section, Nagpur. The same process continued even after Service Tax got subsumed into the Goods and Service Tax (GST) framework. This process of centralised claims submission has been replaced with a system whereby applicable GST (18% at present) shall be paid along with agency commission by the respective Regional Offices of RBI / CAS, Nagpur as the case may be.\n\n24. For eligible government transactions done with effect from July 01, 2019, agency banks shall submit the agency commission claims, including applicable GST amount, as per revised agency commission rates indicated above, to RBI at respective ROs / CAS, Nagpur as per the extant instructions issued by RBI in this regard. TDS on GST shall be deducted as applicable by RBI at the time of making agency commission payment in accordance with Government instructions in the matter.\n\n25. However, for eligible government transactions done by agency banks upto June 30, 2019, agency banks shall continue to submit agency commission claims as well as the centralized claims for ST/GST reimbursement as hitherto.\n\n26. Agency banks are required to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India / Central Accounts Section, Nagpur as applicable in the prescribed format are accurate. Agency banks may also alert their branches concerned to ensure that agency commission claims submitted to our Regional Offices are accurate. Such erroneous claims, if certified by the Internal / Concurrent Auditors, will defeat the very purpose of making such requirement an essential condition for making quarterly claims.\n\n27. Agency banks are advised to furnish their claim on agency commission to Reserve Bank within 60 calendar days from the end of the quarter in which the transactions have been conducted. If the banks fail to lodge the claims within the stipulated period mentioned above they may forward the same to RBI only after giving reasons for delay."

To provide hassle free service to the pensioners, there should be a forum for regular interaction and settlement of grievances. Accordingly, agency banks should appoint one/two nodal officers at each Region/Zone for monitoring the resolution of grievances of pensioners on regular basis and the GM/CGM concerned should review the position at monthly intervals.\n\n17. At locations outside the CPPCs, there should be designated nodal officers for pension related complaints who should be easily accessible to pensioners and who should hold regular meetings at different locations in their jurisdiction on the lines of Pension Adalat.

Studies conducted by NABARD in a few states to assess the impact of the linkage project have brought out encouraging and positive features like increase in loan volume of the SHGs, definite shift in the loaning pattern of the members from non-income generating activities to production activities, nearly 100 per cent recovery performance, significant reduction in the transaction costs for both the banks and the borrowers etc., besides leading to a gradual increase in the income level of the SHG members. Another significant feature observed in the linkage project is that about 85 per cent of the groups linked with banks were formed exclusively by women.\n\n2. Recognizing the importance of SHG Bank linkage, banks have been advised to meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members, as envisaged in Paragraph 93 of the Union Budget announcement for the year 2008-09, made by the Honorable Finance Minister, wherein it was stated as under: ';Banks will be encouraged to embrace the concept of Total Financial Inclusion. Government will request all scheduled commercial banks to follow the example set by some public sector banks and meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members, namely, (a) income generation activities, (b) social needs like housing, education, marriage, etc. and (c) debt swapping';. Linking of SHGs with banks has thus been emphasized in the Monetary Policy Statements of Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget announcements from time to time and various guidelines have been issued to banks in this regard.\n\n3. Banks should provide adequate incentives to their branches in financing the Self Help Groups (SHGs) and establish linkages with them, making the procedures simple and easy. The group dynamics of working of the SHGs need neither be regulated nor formal structures imposed or insisted upon. The approach to financing of SHGs should be totally hassle-free and may also include consumption expenditures. Accordingly, the following guidelines should be adhered to enable effective linkage of SHGs with the banking sector."

It should also form an integral part of the bank’s corporate credit plan.\n\nb) As per operational guidelines issued by NABARD, SHGs may be sanctioned savings linked loans by banks (varying from a saving to loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4). However, in case of matured SHGs, loans may be given beyond the limit of four times the savings as per the discretion of the bank.\n\nc) A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation is a precondition for augmenting flow of credit to SHGs. Banks should strive to remove all operational irritants and make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and disburse credit by delegating adequate sanctioning powers to branch managers. The loan application forms, procedures and documents should be made simple. It would help in providing prompt and hassle-free credit."

It should be binding on the part of the beneficiary to seek confirmation of the Controlling Office / Head Office as well for which a specific stipulation be incorporated in the guarantee itself.\n\n(iv) The guarantees should not normally be allowed to the customers who do not enjoy credit facilities with the banks but only maintain current accounts. If any requests are received from such customers, the banks should subject the proposals to thorough scrutiny and satisfy themselves about the genuine need of the customers. Banks should be satisfied that the customers would be in a position to meet the claims under the guarantees, when received, and not approach the bank for credit facility in this regard. For this purpose the banks should enquire into the financial position of the customers, the source of funds from which they would be in a position to meet the liability and prescribe a suitable margin and obtain other security, as necessary. The banks may also call for the detailed financial statements and Wealth-tax / Income-tax returns of the customer to satisfy themselves of their financial status. The observations of the banks in respect of all these points should be recorded in banks' books.\n\n(v) Where the customers enjoy credit facilities with other banks, the reasons for their approaching the bank for extending the guarantees should be ascertained and invariably, a reference should be made to their existing bankers with whom they are enjoying credit facilities.\n\n(vi) Banks, when approached to issue guarantees in favour of other banks for grant of credit facilities by another bank, should examine thoroughly the reasons for approaching another bank for grant of credit facilities and satisfy themselves of the need for doing so. This should be recorded in bank's books.\n\nWhen it is considered necessary to issue such guarantees, the banks concerned should ensure that the relative guarantee document, beyond a stipulated amount, should not be signed singly but by two authorised officials jointly after obtaining proper sanction and authority and proper record of such guarantee issued being maintained. The credit proposals should be subjected to usual scrutiny by the lending bank ensuring that the proposals conform to the prescribed norms and guidelines and credit facilities are allowed only if the bank is satisfied about the merits of the proposal and the availability of another bank's guarantee should not result in a dilution of the standards of evaluation of the proposal and financial discipline in lending."

Failure on the part of the bank to honour the claim legitimately made on it projects a distorted picture of its functioning.\n\n(iii) In fact some strictures were passed by Courts in the past against banks for not honouring the guarantee commitments promptly. In this connection, an extract of a judgment pronounced by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in a case on the issue of injunctions obtained by parties from courts restraining payment of invoked guarantees is appended :\n\n';We are therefore, of the opinion that the correct position of law is that commitment of banks must be honoured free from interference by the courts and it is only in exceptional cases, that is to say, in case of fraud or in case where irretrievable injustice would be done, if bank guarantee is allowed to be encashed, the court should interfere.';\n\n(iv) The UCBs should, therefore, honour bank guarantees issued by them promptly on their invocation as reluctance on their part to honour commitments in respect of invoked guarantees tend to bring the banking system into disrepute."

Such returns should also reveal the position of bills that have become overdue and which the bank had to meet under the co- acceptance obligation. This will enable the controlling offices to monitor such co-acceptances furnished by the branches and take suitable action in time, in difficult cases."

Member-banks should not, however, open LCs outside the sanctioned limits without the knowledge of the lead bank / other banks;\n\n(vi) if there is no formal consortium arrangement for financing the borrower, LCs should not be opened by the existing bank or a new bank, without the knowledge of the other banks;\n\n(vii) LCs for acquisition of capital goods should be opened only after banks have satisfied themselves about tying up of funds for meeting the relative liability by way of providing for long term funds or term loans from financial institutions / banks;\n\n(viii) In no case, working capital limits should be allowed to be utilised for retiring bills pertaining to acquisition of capital assets.\n\n(ix) Banks should not extend any non-fund based facilities or additional / ad-hoc credit facilities to parties who are not their (the bank's) regular constituents for their production finance requirements; nor should they discount bills drawn under LCs or otherwise for beneficiaries who are not their regular clients. In case it becomes unavoidably necessary to provide such a facility to a party not being a regular client, banks should invariably seek the prior concurrence of the existing banker of the borrowers and also make proper enquiries in regard to the antecedents of the borrowers, their financial position and ability to retire the bills etc. in time.\n\n(x) With effect from March 30, 2012 in case of bills drawn under LCs restricted to a particular UCB, and the beneficiary of the LC is not a borrower who has been granted regular credit facility by that UCB, the UCB concerned may, as per their discretion and based on their perception about the credit worthiness of the LC issuing bank, negotiate such LCs, subject to the condition that the proceeds will be remitted to the regular banker of the beneficiary of the LC. However, the prohibition regarding negotiation of unrestricted LCs for borrowers who have not been sanctioned regular credit facilities will continue to be in force.\n\n(xi) UCBs negotiating bills as above, under restricted LCs, would have to adhere to the instructions of the Reserve Bank / RCS or CRCS regarding share linking to borrowing and provisions of Co-operative Societies Act on membership"

                "content": "(i) There have been a few instances where LCs were opened by officials of banks in an unauthorised manner. In certain cases, the LCs transactions were not recorded in the books of the branch by officials issuing them, while in some other cases the amounts of LCs were much in excess of the powers vested in them for the purpose. Subsequently when the banks come to know about the fraudulent issue of LCs, they disclaim liability on the ground that these are transactions involving a conspiracy / collusion between the beneficiary and the constituent.\n\n(ii) It may be appreciated that if the bills drawn under LCs are not honoured, it will adversely affect the character of LCs and the relative bills as an accepted means of payment. This could also affect the credibility of the entire payment mechanism through banks and affect the image of the banks. It is, therefore, necessary that all the banks should honour their commitments under LCs and make payments promptly leaving no opportunity for any complaints in this regard. Needless to say that banks should take suitable action against the concerned officials as well as the constituents on whose behalf the LCs are opened and the beneficiaries of LCs, if a criminal conspiracy is involved."

                "content": "(i) UCBs are required to strictly observe exposure norms and statutory / other restrictions prescribed for non-fund based limits (e.g. LCs, Guarantees, Co-acceptances, etc.) as detailed in the Master Circular on 'Exposure Norms and Statutory / Other Restrictions and other norms issued by RBI from time to time.\n\n(ii) The exposure ceilings and other restrictions particularly prescribed for\n\n4.2 Banks should ensure that the systems evolved for recording the details of off-balance sheet transactions are properly followed by all branches. These records should be periodically balanced and internal inspectors should verify the same and offer critical comments.\n\n4.3 Banks should ensure that unauthorised LCs are not issued.\n\n4.4 Banks must lay down clear instructions for their branch staff in respect of loan accounts where such non-funded facilities become funded on account of devolvement of bills covered under the bank's LCs or due to invocation of guarantees issued by the bank. The banks must evolve proper guidelines to ensure that, accounts where non-funded limits become ';funded'; are closely monitored and goods covered under devolved bills remain under bank's control / hypothecation, particularly where malafides are suspected. In cases of goods covered under import LCs, banks must also ensure immediate submission of custom's copy of the Bill of Entry and take measures as prescribed in the guidelines issued by Foreign Exchange Department.\n\n4.5 A number of banks adopt the practice of parking the dues of the borrower in respect of devolved LCs and invoked guarantees in a separate account which is not a regular sanctioned facility. As a result, these are not reflected in the principal operating account of the borrower. This renders application of the prudential norms for identification of NPAs difficult. It is, therefore, advised that if the debts arising out of devolvement of LCs or invoked guarantees are parked in a separate account, the balance outstanding in that account also should be treated as a part of the borrower's principal operating account for the purpose of application of prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning.\n\n4.6 Banks are encouraged to strengthen their information back up about the borrowers enjoying credit facilities from multiple banks by obtaining declaration from the borrowers about the credit facilities already enjoyed by them from other banks. In the case of existing lenders, all the banks may seek a declaration from their existing borrowers availing sanctioned limits of Rs.5.00 crore and above or wherever, it is in their knowledge that their borrowers are availing credit facilities from other banks and introduce a system of exchange of information with other banks. Subsequently banks should exchange information about the conduct of the borrowers' accounts with other banks at least at quarterly intervals. Banks should also make use of CRILC or credit reports available from Credit Information Companies. The banks should incorporate suitable clauses in the loan agreements regarding exchange of credit information so as to address confidentiality issues. Banks should also obtain regular certification by a professional, preferably a Company Secretary, Chartered Accountant or Cost Accountant regarding compliance of various statutory prescriptions that are in vogue. The formats for collecting information from the borrowers, exchange of information among banks and certification by a professional are furnished in our circular UBD.PCB.No.36/13.05.000/2008-09 dated January 21, 2009 read with circular UBD.PCB.No.59/13.05.000/2008-09 dated April 9, 2009.\n\n4.7 Banks are exposed to various risks in every financial transaction including commitments in the form of Guarantees, Co-acceptances, LCs etc. The managements of UCBs have to base their business decisions on sound risk management systems with the ultimate objective of protecting the interest of depositors and stakeholders. It is, therefore, important that UCBs adopt effective Asset-Liability Management (ALM) systems to address the issues related to liquidity, interest rate and currency risks. Banks should invariably follow the ALM guidelines issued by Reserve Bank in this regard."

                "content": "An important criterion for judging the soundness of a banking institution is the size and character, not only of its assets portfolio but also, of its contingent liability commitments such as guarantees, letters of credit, etc. As a part of business, banks issue guarantees on behalf of their customers for various purposes. The guarantees executed by banks comprise both performance guarantees and financial guarantees. The guarantees are structured according to the terms of agreement, viz., security, maturity and purpose. Banks should comply with the following guidelines in the conduct of their guarantee business."

However, where banks extend long term loans for periods longer than 10 years for various projects, it has been decided to allow banks to also issue guarantees for periods beyond 10 years. While issuing such guarantees, banks are advised to take into account the impact of very long duration guarantees on their Asset Liability Management. Further, banks may evolve a policy on issuance of guarantees beyond 10 years as considered appropriate with the approval of their Board of Directors.\n\n2.1.4 Banks should, in general, refrain from issuing non-fund based facilities to/on behalf of constituents who do not enjoy credit facilities with them. However, banks are permitted to grant non-fund based facilities, including partial credit enhancement1, to those customers, who do not avail any fund based facility from any bank in India. Provision of such facilities shall be in terms of a comprehensive Board approved policy for grant of non-fund based facility to such borrowers. The banks shall ensure that the borrower has not availed any fund based facility from any bank operating in India. However, at the time of granting non-fund based facilities, banks shall obtain declaration from the customer about the non- fund based credit facilities already enjoyed by them from other banks. Banks shall undertake the same level of credit appraisal as has been laid down for fund based facilities. The instructions related to KYC / AML / CFT, submission of credit information to Credit Information Companies and other prudential norms applicable to banks, including exposure norms, issued by RBI from time to time, shall be adhered to in respect of all such facility. However, banks are prohibited from negotiating unrestricted LCs of non-constituents. In cases where negotiation of bills drawn under LC is restricted to a particular bank and the beneficiary of the LC is not a constituent of that bank, the bank shall have the option to negotiate such LCs, subject to the condition that the proceeds are remitted to the regular banker of the beneficiary.\n\n2.1.5 Further, BG /LC may be issued by scheduled commercial banks to clients of co-operative banks against counter guarantee of the co-operative bank as permitted hitherto. In such cases, banks shall be guided by the provisions of paragraph 2.3.8.2 of the Master Circular on Loans and Advances-Statutory and Other Restrictions dated July 1, 2015 as amended from time to time. Further, in such cases banks must satisfy themselves that the concerned co-operative banks have sound credit appraisal and monitoring systems as well as robust Know Your Customer (KYC) regime. Before issuing BG/LCs to specific constituents of co-operative banks, they must satisfy themselves that KYC check has been done properly in these cases.\n\n2.1.6 The guarantee of parent companies may be obtained in the case of subsidiaries whose own financial condition is not considered satisfactory."

In order to provide further flexibility to banks on their loan policies, the above limit on unsecured exposure of banks was withdrawn and banks' Boards have been given the freedom to fix their own policies on their unsecured exposures. ';Unsecured exposure'; is defined as an exposure where the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank/ approved valuers / Reserve Bank's inspecting officers, is not more than 10 per cent, ab-initio, of the outstanding exposure. Exposure shall include all funded and non-funded exposures (including underwriting and similar commitments). 'Security' will mean tangible security properly charged to the bank and will not include intangible securities like guarantees (including State government guarantees), letter of comfort, etc.\n\n2.2.1.2 For determining the amount of unsecured advances for reflecting in schedule 9 of the published balance sheet, the rights, licenses, authorisations, etc., charged to the banks as collateral in respect of projects (including infrastructure projects) financed by them, should not be reckoned as tangible security. Banks, may however, treat annuities under build-operate –transfer (BOT) model in respect of road/highway projects and toll collection rights where there are provisions to compensate the project sponsor if a certain level of traffic is not achieved, as tangible securities, subject to the condition that banks' right to receive annuities and toll collection rights is legally enforceable and irrevocable.\n\n2.2.1.3 All exemptions allowed for computation of unsecured advances stand withdrawn."

Guarantees on behalf of an individual should also bear a reasonable proportion to the constituent's equity.\n\n(iii) In exceptional cases, banks may give deferred payment guarantees on an unsecured basis for modest amounts to first class customers who have entered into deferred payment arrangements in consonance with Government policy.\n\n(iv) Guarantees executed on behalf of any individual constituent, or a group of constituents, should be subject to the prescribed exposure norms.\n\n(v) It is essential to realise that guarantees contain inherent risks and that it would not be in the bank's interest or in the public interest, generally, to encourage parties to over-extend their commitments and embark upon enterprises solely relying on the easy availability of guarantee facilities."

The responsibility for ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems and procedures for preventing perpetration of frauds and malpractices by their officials would, in such cases, rest on the top managements of the banks.

However, certain facilities which, inter alia, include issue of guarantees, are not regarded as 'loan and advances' within the meaning of Section 20 of the Act, ibid. In this regard, it is pertinent to note with particular reference to banks giving guarantees on behalf of their directors, that in the event of the principal debtor committing default in discharging his liability and the bank being called upon to honour its obligation under the guarantee, the relationship between the bank and the director could become one of creditor and debtor. Further, directors would also be able to evade the provisions of Section 20 by borrowing from a third party against the guarantee given by the bank. These types of transactions are likely to defeat the very purpose of Section 20 of the Act, if banks do not take appropriate steps to ensure that the liabilities there under do not devolve on them.\n\n2.2.6.2 In view of the above, banks should, while extending non-fund based facilities such as guarantees, etc. on behalf of their directors and the companies/firms in which the director is interested, ensure that:\n\n(i) adequate and effective arrangements have been made to the satisfaction of the bank that the commitments would be met out of their own resources by the party on whose behalf guarantee was issued and\n\n(ii) the bank will not be called upon to grant any loan or advance to meet the liability, consequent upon the invocation of the guarantee.\n\nIn case, such contingencies arise as at (ii) above, the bank will be deemed to be a party to the violation of the provisions of Section 20 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949."

In fact, in the case of widely owned public limited companies, which may be rated as first class and satisfying the above conditions, guarantees may not be necessary even if the advances are unsecured. Also, in the case of companies, whether private or public, which are under professional management, guarantees may not be insisted upon from persons who are connected with the management solely by virtue of their professional/technical qualifications and not consequent upon any significant shareholding in the company concerned.\n\n(ii) Where the lending institutions are not so convinced about the aspects of loan proposals mentioned above, they should seek to stipulate conditions to make the proposals acceptable without such guarantees. In some cases, more stringent forms of financial discipline like restrictions on distribution of dividends, further expansion, aggregate borrowings, creation of further charge on assets and stipulation of maintenance of minimum net working capital may be necessary. Also, the parity between owned funds and capital investment and the overall debt-equity ratio may have to be taken into account."

Where personal guarantee is considered necessary, the guarantee should preferably be that of the principal members of the group holding shares in the borrowing company rather than that of the director/managerial personnel functioning as director or in any managerial capacity.\n\n(ii) Even if a company is not closely held, there may be justification for a personal guarantee of directors to ensure continuity of management. Thus, a lending institution could make a loan to a company whose management is considered good. Subsequently, a different group could acquire control of the company, which could lead the lending institution to have well-founded fears that the management has changed for the worse and that the funds lent to the company are in jeopardy. One way by which lending institutions could protect themselves in such circumstances is to obtain guarantees of the directors and thus ensure either the continuity of the management or that the changes in management take place with their knowledge. Even where personal guarantees are waived, it may be necessary to obtain an undertaking from the borrowing company that no change in the management would be made without the consent of the lending institution. Similarly, during the formative stages of a company, it may be in the interest of the company, as well as the lending institution, to obtain guarantees to ensure continuity of management.\n\n(iii) Personal guarantees may be helpful with regard to public limited companies other than those which may be rated as first class, where the advance is on an unsecured basis.\n\n(iv) There may be public limited companies, whose financial position and/or capacity for cash generation is not satisfactory even though the relevant advances are secured. In such cases, personal guarantees are useful.\n\n(v) Cases where there is likely to be considerable delay in the creation of a charge on assets, guarantee may be taken, where deemed necessary, to cover the interim period between the disbursement of loan and the creation of the charge on assets.\n\n(vi) Personal guarantees are relevant where the balance sheet or financial statement of a company discloses interlocking of funds between the company and other concerns owned or managed by a group."

This requirement should be incorporated in the bank's terms and conditions for sanctioning of credit limits. During the periodic inspections, the bank's inspectors should verify that this stipulation has been complied with.

In case, for any reasons, a guarantee is not considered expedient by the bank at the time of sanctioning the advance, an undertaking should be obtained from the individual directors and a covenant should invariably be incorporated in the loan agreement that in case the borrowing unit shows cash losses or adverse current ratio or diversion of fund, the directors would be under an obligation to execute guarantees in their individual capacities, if required by the bank.

This stipulation will apply to all sources of funds raised by such entities, e.g. deposits/ loans received from trusts and other institutions.\n\n2.4.2 Transactions of the following types are in the nature of guarantees executed by banks in respect of funds made available by one non-banking entity to another non-banking entity and banks should therefore, desist from such practices:\n\n(i) A seller drew bills, normally of 120 to 180 days usance, on the buyer which were accepted by the buyer and co-accepted by his banker. The bills were discounted by the seller with the accommodating company, which retained the bills till the due date. The bank which gave co-acceptance invariably earmarked funds for the liability under the bills against the drawing power in respect of stocks held in the cash credit account of its client, the buyer, or\n\n(ii) The accommodating company kept deposits for a specific period with the bank's borrowers under a guarantee executed by the bank. In such a case also, the bank earmarked the amount against drawing power available in the cash credit account.\n\n2.4.3.1 Banks may issue guarantees favouring other banks/ FIs/ other lending agencies for the loans extended by the latter, subject to strict compliance with the following conditions.\n\n(i) The Board of Directors should reckon the integrity/ robustness of the bank's risk management systems and, accordingly, put in place a well-laid out policy in this regard.\n\nThe Board approved policy should, among others, address the following issues:\n\n(ii) The guarantee shall be extended only in respect of borrower constituents and to enable them to avail of additional credit facility from other banks/FIs/lending agencies.\n\n(iii) The guaranteeing bank should assume a funded exposure of at least 10% of the exposure guaranteed.\n\n(iv) Banks should not extend guarantees or letters of comfort in favour of overseas lenders including those assignable to overseas lenders. However, AD banks may also be guided by the provisions contained in Notification No. FEMA 8/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000 and subsequent amendments thereof.\n\n(v) The guarantee issued by the bank will be an exposure on the borrowing entity on whose behalf the guarantee has been issued and will attract appropriate risk weight, as per the extant guidelines.\n\n(vi) Of late, certain banks have been issuing guarantees on behalf of corporate entities in respect of non-convertible debentures issued by such entities. It is clarified that the extant instructions apply only to loans and not to bonds or debt instruments. Guarantees by the banking system for a corporate bond or any debt instrument not only have significant systemic implications but also impede the development of a genuine corporate debt market. Banks are advised to strictly comply with the extant regulations and in particular, not to provide guarantees for issuance of bonds or debt instruments of any kind. However, banks are permitted to provide partial credit enhancement (PCE) to bonds issued by corporates /special purpose vehicles (SPVs), NBFC-ND-SIs and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) subject to conditions stipulated in circular DBR.BP.BC.No.40/21.04.142/2015-16 dated September 24, 2015 on Partial Credit Enhancement to Corporate Bonds and other associated circulars issued subsequently on the subject. The PCE shall be provided only in the form of a non-funded irrevocable contingent line of credit."

Since the exposure assumed by the bank against the guarantee of another bank/FI will be for a fairly longer term than those assumed on account of inter-bank dealings in the money market, foreign exchange market and securities market, the Board of Directors should fix an appropriate sub-limit for the longer term exposures, since these exposures attract greater risk.\n\n(iii) Banks should monitor the exposure assumed on the guaranteeing bank/ FI, on a continuous basis and ensure strict compliance with the prudential limits/ sub limits prescribed by their Boards and the prudential single borrower limits prescribed by RBI for banks/FIs."

As such, buyer's banks are permitted to extend guarantee/ co-acceptance facility for the bills drawn under seller's line of credit.\n\n2.4.4.3 Similarly, guarantees can be issued in favour of HUDCO/ State Housing Boards and similar bodies/ organisations for the loans granted by them to private borrowers who are unable to offer clear and marketable title to property, provided banks are otherwise satisfied with the capacity of the borrowers to adequately service such loans.\n\n2.4.4.4 Banks may issue guarantees in favour of various Development Agencies/Boards, like Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, National Horticulture Board, etc. for obtaining soft loans and/or other forms of development assistance from such Agencies/Boards with the objective of improving efficiency, productivity, etc., subject to the following conditions:"

                "content": "2.5.1 Where guarantees are invoked, payment should be made to the beneficiaries without delay and demur. An appropriate procedure for ensuring such immediate honouring of guarantees should be laid down so that there is no delay on the pretext that legal advice or approval of higher authorities is being obtained.\n\n2.5.2  Delays on the part of banks in honouring the guarantees when invoked tend to erode the value of the bank guarantees, the sanctity of the scheme of guarantees and image of banks. It also provides an opportunity to the parties to take recourse to courts and obtain injunction orders. In the case of guarantees in favour of Government departments, this not only delays the revenue collection efforts but also gives an erroneous impression that banks are actively in collusion with the parties, which tarnishes the image of the banking system.\n\n2.5.3 There should be an effective system to ensure that the persons on whose behalf the guarantees are issued will be in a position to perform their obligations in the case of performance guarantees and honour their commitments out of their own resources, as and when needed, in the case of financial guarantees.\n\n2.5.4 The top management of the banks should bestow their personal attention to the need to put in place a proper mechanism for making payments in respect of invoked guarantees promptly, so that no room is given for such complaints. When complaints are made, particularly by the Government departments for not honouring the guarantees issued, the top management of the bank, including its Chief Executive Officer, should personally look into such complaints.\n\n2.5.5 In this regard, the Delhi High Court has made adverse remarks against certain banks in not promptly honouring the commitment of guarantees when invoked. It has been observed that a bank guarantee is a contract between the beneficiary and the bank. When the beneficiary invokes the bank guarantee and a letter invoking the same is sent in terms of the bank guarantee, it is obligatory on the bank to make payment to the beneficiary.\n\n2.5.6 The Supreme Court had observed [U.P. Co-operative Federation Private Ltd. versus Singh Consultants and Engineers Private Ltd. (1988 IC SSC 174)] that the commitments of the banks must be honoured, free from interference by the courts. The relevant extract from the judgement of the Supreme Court in a case is as under:\n\n'We are, therefore, of the opinion that the correct position of law is that commitment of banks must be honoured free from interference by the courts and it is only in exceptional cases, that is, to say, in case of fraud or any case where irretrievable injustice would be done if bank guarantee is allowed to be encashed, the court should interfere'.\n\n2.5.7 In order to avoid such situations, it is absolutely essential for banks to appraise the proposals for guarantees with the same diligence, as in the case of fund based limits, and obtain adequate cover by way of margin so as to prevent the constituents to develop a tendency of defaulting in payments when invoked guarantees are honoured by the banks.\n\n2.5.8  (i) Banks are required to ensure that the guarantees issued by them are honoured without delay and hesitation when they are invoked in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee deed, unless there is a Court order restraining the banks.\n\n(ii) Any decision not to honour the obligation under the guarantee invoked may be taken after careful consideration, at a fairly senior level, and only in the circumstances where the bank is satisfied that any such payment to the beneficiary would not be deemed a rightful payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.\n\n(iii) The Chief Executive Officers of banks should assume personal responsibility for such complaints received from Government departments. Sufficient powers should be delegated to the line functionaries so that delay on account of reference to higher authorities for payment under the guarantee does not occur.\n\n(iv) For any non-payment of guarantee in time, staff accountability should be fixed and stern disciplinary action including award of major penalty such as dismissal, should be taken against the delinquent officials at all levels.\n\n(v) Where banks have executed bank guarantees in favour of Customs and Central Excise authorities to cover differential duty amounts in connection with interim orders issued by High Courts, the guarantee amount should be released immediately when they are invoked on vacation of the stay orders by Courts. Banks should not hold back the amount on the pretext that it would affect their liquidity position.\n\n2.5.9 There have also been complaints by Ministry of Finance that some of the departments such as Department of Revenue, Government of India are finding it difficult to execute judgements delivered by various Courts in their favour as banks do not honour their guarantees, unless certified copies of the Court judgements are made available to them. In this regard, the banks may follow the following procedure:\n\n(i) Where the bank is a party to the proceedings initiated by Government for enforcement of the bank guarantee and the case is decided in favour of the Government by the Court, banks should not insist on production of certified copy of the judgement, as the judgement/ order is pronounced in open Court in presence of the parties/ their counsels and the judgement is known to the bank and a copy of the judgement is available on websites of the Courts.\n\n(ii) In case the bank is not a party to the proceedings, a signed copy of the minutes of the order certified by the Registrar/ Deputy or Assistant Registrar of the High Court or the ordinary copy of the judgement/ order of the High Court, duly attested to be true copy by Government Counsel, should be sufficient for honouring the obligation under guarantee, unless the guarantor bank decides to file any appeal against the order of the High Court.\n\n(iii) Banks should honour the guarantees issued by them as and when they are invoked in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee deeds. In case of any disputes, such honouring can be done under protest, if necessary, and the matters of dispute pursued separately.\n\n(iv) The Government, on their part, have advised the various Government departments, etc. that the invocation of guarantees should be done after careful consideration at a senior-level that a default has occurred in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantees and as provided in the guarantee deed.\n\n(v) Non-compliance of the instructions in regard to honouring commitments under invoked guarantees will be viewed by Reserve Bank very seriously and Reserve Bank will be constrained to take deterrent action against the banks."

These bills subsequently turn out to be accommodation bills drawn by groups of sister concerns on each other where no genuine trade transaction takes place. Banks, while discounting such bills, appear to ignore this important aspect presumably because of the co-acceptance given by other banks. The bills, on maturity, are not honoured by the drawees and the banks which co-accept the bills have to make payment of these bills, and they find it difficult to recover the amount from the drawers/ drawees of bills. Banks also discount bills for sizeable amounts, which are co-accepted by certain Urban Co-operative Banks. On maturity, the bills are not honoured and the co-operative banks, which co-accept the bills, also find it difficult to make the payment. The financial position and capacity of the co-accepting bank to honour the bills, in the event of need, is not being looked into. Cases have also been observed where the particulars regarding co-acceptance of bills are not recorded in the bank's books, with the result that the same cannot be verified during inspections, and the Head Office becomes aware of the co-acceptance only when a claim is received from the discounting bank."

This will enable the Controlling Offices to monitor such co-acceptances furnished by the branches and take suitable action in time, in difficult cases.\n\n(xiii) Co-acceptances in respect of bills for Rs.10,000/- and above should be signed by two officials jointly, deviation being allowed only in exceptional cases, e.g. non-availability of two officials at a branch.\n\n(xiv) Before discounting/ purchasing bills co-accepted by other banks for Rs. 2 lakh and above from a single party, the bank should obtain written confirmation of the concerned Controlling (Regional/ Divisional/ Zonal) Office of the accepting bank and a record of the same should be kept.\n\n(xv) When the value of the total bills discounted/ purchased (which have been co-accepted by other banks) exceeds Rs. 20 lakh for a single borrower/ group of borrowers, prior approval of the Head Office of the co-accepting bank must be obtained by the discounting bank in writing.\n\n2.6.2.1 In addition to the above safeguards to be observed by banks in co-accepting the bills, it must be noted that the banks are precluded from co-accepting bills drawn under Buyers Line of Credit Schemes introduced by IDBI Bank Ltd. and all India financial institutions like SIDBI, Power Finance Corporation Ltd. (PFC), etc. Similarly, banks should not co-accept bills drawn by NBFCs. In addition, banks are advised not to extend co-acceptance on behalf of their buyers/constituents under the SIDBI Scheme.\n\n2.6.2.2 However, banks may co-accept bills drawn under the Sellers Line of Credit Schemes (since renamed as Direct Discounting Scheme) operated by IDBI Bank Ltd.4 and all India financial institutions for Bill Discounting operated by IDBI Bank Ltd.5 and all India financial institutions like SIDBI, PFC, etc. without any limit, subject to the buyer's capability to pay, and compliance with the exposure norms prescribed by the bank for individual/ group borrowers.\n\n2.6.2.3 There have been instances where branches of banks open L/Cs on behalf of their constituents and also co-accept the bills drawn under such L/Cs. Legally, if a bank co-accepts a bill drawn under its own L/C, the bill so co-accepted becomes an independent document. The special rules applicable to commercial credits do not apply to such a bill and the bill is exclusively governed by the law relating to Bills of Exchange, i.e. the Negotiable Instruments Act. The negotiating bank of such a bill is not under any obligation to check the particulars of the bill with reference to the terms of the L/C. This practice is, therefore, superfluous and defeats the purpose of issuing the L/C. The discounting banks should first ascertain from the co-accepting banks, the reason for such co-acceptance of bills drawn under their own L/C and only after satisfying themselves of genuineness of such transactions, they may consider discounting such bills.\n\n2.6.2.4 It should be ensured that the branch officials strictly adhere to the above referred instructions at the time of co-acceptance of bills. It would be advisable to determine clear accountability in this respect and officials found to be not complying with the instructions must be dealt with sternly."

                "content": "(i) The genesis of the Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) can be traced to the Study Group headed by Prof. D. R. Gadgil (Gadgil Study Group) on the Organizational Framework for Implementation of the Social Objectives, which submitted its report in October 1969. The Study Group drew attention to the fact that commercial banks did not have adequate presence in rural areas and also lacked the required rural orientation. The Study Group, therefore, recommended the adoption of an 'Area Approach' to evolve plans and programmes for the development of an adequate banking and credit structure in the rural areas.\n\n(ii) A Committee of Bankers on Branch Expansion Programme of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) appointed by the Reserve Bank of India under the Chairmanship of Shri F. K. F. Nariman (Nariman Committee) endorsed the idea of an ‘Area Approach’ in its report (November 1969), recommending that in order to enable the PSBs to discharge their social responsibilities, each bank should concentrate on certain districts where it should act as a 'Lead Bank'.\n\n(iii) Pursuant to the above recommendations, the LBS was introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in December 1969.The Scheme aims at coordinating the activities of banks and other developmental agencies through various fora to achieve the objective of enhancing the flow of bank finance to the priority sector and other sectors and to promote banks' role in the overall development of the rural sector. For coordinating the activities in a district, a particular bank is assigned ‘Lead Bank’ responsibility of the district. The Lead Bank is expected to assume a leadership role for coordinating the efforts of the credit institutions and the Government.\n\n(iv) In view of the several changes that had taken place in the financial sector, the LBS was last reviewed by the High Level Committee headed by Smt. Usha Thorat, former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in 2009.\n\n(v) The Committee held wide ranging discussions with various stakeholders, viz., State Governments, banks, development institutions, academicians, NGOs, MFIs, etc. and noted that the scheme has been useful in achieving its original objectives of improvement in branch expansion, deposit mobilisation and lending to the priority sector, especially in rural/semi urban areas. There was overwhelming consensus that LBS needs to continue. Based on the recommendations of the Committee, guidelines were issued to State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) Convenor banks and Lead Banks for implementation.\n\n(vi) Envisaging greater role for private sector banks (PvSBs), Lead Banks were advised to ensure that PvSBs are more closely and actively involved in the implementation of the LBS, by leveraging on Information Technology and bringing in their expertise in strategic planning. They were also advised to involve themselves in preparation as well as implementation of the District Credit Plan (DCP).\n\n(vii) Further, RBI constituted a “Committee of Executive Directors” of the Bank to study the efficacy of the scheme and suggest measures for its improvement. Based on the Committee’s recommendations and feedback received from various stakeholders, certain ‘action points’ were issued to SLBC Convenors/Lead Banks and NABARD on April 6, 2018."

The forum prepares and reviews the implementation of the Block Credit Plan and resolves operational issues in the implementation of the credit programmes of banks. The Lead District Manager (LDM) of the district is the Chairman of the BLBC. All the banks operating in the block including Small Finance Banks (SFBs), Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) of Foreign Banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), District Central Co-operative Banks (DCCBs), Block Development Officer, technical officers in the block such as extension officers for agriculture, industries and co-operatives are members of the Committee. BLBC meetings are held at quarterly intervals. To strengthen the BLBC forum, which operates at the base level of the LBS, it is necessary that all branch managers attend BLBC meetings and enrich the discussions with their valuable inputs. Controlling Heads of banks may also attend a few of the BLBC meetings selectively. Participation by the District Development Manager (DDM) of NABARD in BLBCs would ensure better and more meaningful discussions for the development of the Block. Therefore, NABARD has been advised that DDMs should attend all BLBC meetings in their districts and actively participate in the credit planning exercise and review meetings at the block level. The Lead District Officer (LDO) of the RBI selectively attends the BLBC meetings. Representatives of Panchayat Samitis are also invited to attend the meetings at half yearly intervals to share their knowledge and experience on rural development in the credit planning exercise.

SLBC Convenor Banks have therefore been advised to give wide publicity to the annual calendar at the beginning of the year and ensure that dates of senior functionaries expected to attend the meetings are blocked for all meetings by their offices. In case, despite blocking dates, if for some reason, the senior functionary is not able to attend the meeting, the meeting should be held as planned in the calendar. More importantly, the data for review in these meetings should be received as per deadlines set in the calendar and those who do not submit the data in time should be asked to explain the reasons for delay in sending the data that may be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

Such initiatives must be supported by appropriate investments and project finance frameworks.\n\nii) A pre-PLP meeting is convened by the LDM during June every year to be attended by banks, Government agencies, etc., to reflect their views and concerns regarding credit potential (sector/activity-wise) and deliberate on major financial and socio-economic developments in the district in the last one year and priorities to be set out for inclusion in the PLP. The DDM of NABARD makes a presentation in this meeting outlining the major requirements of information for preparing the PLP for the following year. The preparation of PLP for the next year is to be completed by August every year to enable the State Government to factor in the PLP projections.\n\niii) The procedure for preparing the District Credit Plan is as follows:\n\na) Controlling Offices of commercial banks including SFBs, WOS of Foreign Banks and Head Office of RRBs and DCCB/LDB circulate the accepted block-wise/activity-wise potential to all their branches for preparing the BCP by their respective branch managers. Banks should ensure that the exercise of preparation of branch/block plans is completed in time by all branches so that the Credit Plans become operational on time.\n\nb) A special BLBC meeting is convened for each block where the BCPs are discussed and aggregated to form the Block Credit Plan. The DDM and the LDM guide the BLBC in finalizing the plan, ensuring that the Block Credit Plan is in tune with the potentials identified activity-wise, including in respect of Government Sponsored Schemes.\n\nc) All the Block Credit Plans of the district are aggregated by the LDM to form the District Credit Plan (DCP). This plan indicates an analytical assessment of the credit needs of the district to be deployed by all the financial institutions operating in the district and the total quantum of funds to be earmarked as credit by all the financial institutions for a new financial year. The Zonal/Controlling Offices of banks, while finalizing their business plans for the year, should take into account the commitments made in the DCP which should be ready well in time before the performance budgets are finalized.\n\nd) The DCP is then placed before the DCC by the Lead District Manager for final acceptance/approval. All the DCPs are eventually aggregated into a State Level Credit Plan to be prepared by the SLBC Convenor Bank and launched by the 1st of April every year.\n\ne) The corporate business targets for branches, blocks, districts and states may be aligned with the Annual Credit Plans (ACP) to ensure better implementation. The Controlling Offices of the banks in each state should synchronize their internal business plans with the ACP."

Revised guidelines on ‘Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy’ issued by the Department of Regulation (DoR), RBI on May 18, 2017 advised banks to consider opening of a CBS-enabled banking outlet or a part time banking outlet, as the case may be, in unbanked rural centres.\n\niii) SLBC Convenor Banks should take up with the State Governments/ other Government departments concerned, impeders, such as, issues of road/digital connectivity, conducive law and order situation, uninterrupted power supply, adequate security, etc., for ensuring banking expansion at all centres where penetration by the formal banking system is required. However, these impeders should not inhibit the scaling up of financial inclusion initiatives."

Hence, it may be considered at district level for computing CD ratio.\n\nAs regards calculation of CD ratio based on limit sanctioned/ amount outstanding, it is clarified that the CD ratio may be calculated on the basis of amount outstanding.\n\nFurther, banks are advised that:\n\nIn districts having CD Ratio less than 40 percent, Special Sub-Committees (SSCs) of the DCC shall be set up to monitor the CD Ratio.\n\nii) SSCs of the DCC should be set up in the districts having CD Ratio less than 40 percent, to monitor the CD Ratio and to draw up Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs) to increase the CD Ratio. The LDM is designated as the Convenor of the SSC which, in addition to the District Co-ordinators of banks functioning in the area, should comprise of the LDO of RBI, the DDM of NABARD, the District Planning Officer or a representative of the Collector duly empowered to take decisions on behalf of the district administration.\n\nThe functions of the SSC are as under:\n\niii) As regards the districts with CD Ratio less than 20 percent, these are generally located in hilly, desert or inaccessible terrains and/ or those dependent solely on the primary sector and/ or characterized by a breakdown of the law and order machinery. In such areas, conventional methods are not likely to work unless the banking system and the State Government come together in a specially meaningful way.\n\niv) While the framework for implementation for raising the CD Ratio in these districts will be the same as in the case of districts with CD Ratio below 40 percent (i.e., setting up of SSC etc.), the focus of attention and the level of efforts should be of a much higher scale.\n\nFor this,"

The primary objective of SAA was to increase productive lending and forge effective linkages between bank credit, production, productivity and increase in income levels.\n\nii) The SAA scheme was reviewed in December 2004 and it was decided to dispense with the restrictive provisions of the scheme, while retaining the positive features of the SAA, such as, credit planning and monitoring of the credit purveyance. Accordingly, under SAA, the allocation of villages among the rural and semi-urban branches of banks were made not applicable for lending except under Government Sponsored Schemes. Thus, while the commercial banks and RRBs are free to lend in any rural and semi-urban area, the borrowers have the choice of approaching any branch for their credit requirements."

                "content": "1.1 Primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs or banks) have been functioning under the regulation and supervision of Reserve Bank of India (Reserve Bank or RBI) in terms of the powers vested in it inter alia under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act) and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (RBI Act).\n\n1.2 The directors on the boards of UCBs must be knowledgeable and persons of high integrity. To ensure professionalism in the Board, banks should, at all times, have at least two professional directors, i.e., persons with suitable banking experience (at middle/senior management level) or with relevant professional qualification in the fields of law, accountancy or finance. Banks should also have a suitable provision in their byelaws to ensure this. However, these instructions would not be insisted upon in case of Salary Earners' Banks in view of the nature of their membership.\n\n1.3 UCBs (other than those having deposit size less than Rs.100 crore and salary earners’ banks) are also required to constitute a Board of Management (BoM) to facilitate professional management and focused attention to their banking-related activities, by making suitable amendments to their bye-laws, in accordance with the guidelines contained in RBI circular DoR(PCB).BPD.Cir.No.8/12.05.002/2019-20 dated December 31, 2019.\n\n1.4 Since the directors are elected from amongst the members (except co-opted and nominated directors), the persons who are not eligible for admission even as members cannot become directors of UCBs. In particular, persons engaged in money lending, financing and investment activities, either in individual capacity or as proprietor/partner/employee/director of any concern as also those convicted of any criminal offences including moral turpitude are ineligible in terms of clause b (ii) of the model by-law no.9 and/or the provisions contained in the co-operative societies law concerned. Besides, certain eligibility/qualification/disqualification criteria for becoming director in a UCB are also prescribed in the BR Act and the co-operative laws concerned.\n\n1.5 The recommendations made by the “Committee on Urban Co-operative Banks”, headed by Shri Madhava Das, regarding the Board of Directors of UCBs and recommended by the Reserve Bank for adoption by the banks are given in Annex 1.\n\n1.6 It was observed during the course of supervisory reviews that some of the UCBs have adopted the practice of creating honorary designations (remunerated or otherwise) / conferring titles at Board level, such as Chairman Emeritus, Group Chairman, etc., which are not recognised in applicable statutes or regulations. While such positions/titles may be indicative of certain privileges/rights for the incumbent to access all board materials and participate in board/committee meetings, enforcing liability or obligations on such person may be difficult. Such positions may be seen as creating conflicts of interest as well as creation of a parallel or shadow authority impeding effective and independent functioning of the legally constituted board in the best interest of all its stakeholders. As such, UCBs are directed not to create any honorary positions/titles at Board level or confer such titles that are non-statutory in nature1."

The directors should attend Board meetings regularly and effectively. They should study the Board papers thoroughly and use the good offices of the MD/CEO for eliciting any information at the Board meetings. They should, however, not directly call for papers/files/notes recorded by various departments for scrutiny, etc. in respect of agenda items to be discussed in the meetings.\n\nii. Management, on its part, is expected to furnish full facts and complete papers to the directors well in advance as also all additional information/clarification that the directors may seek before taking a decision. The directors are expected to ensure confidentiality of the Bank's agenda papers/notes. They should not reveal any information relating to any constituent of the bank to anyone as they are under the oath of secrecy and fidelity.\n\niii. The directors should involve themselves thoroughly in the matter of formulation of general policy and ensure that performance of the bank is monitored adequately at the Board level. They should not issue/give any instructions/direction to any individual officer/employee of the bank in any manner, and should also discourage the individual officer/employee or unions from approaching them in any manner.\n\niv. The directors should be familiar with the broad objectives of the bank and the policies laid down by the Reserve Bank. They should analyse the trends of economy, assist in the discharge of management's responsibility to public and formulation of measures to improve customer service and be generally of constructive assistance to the bank management.\n\nv. The Board should function in a cohesive manner and provide proper leadership to manage the affairs of the bank on smooth and efficient lines. The directors must work as a team and in the spirit of co-operation and should give as much of their wisdom, guidance and knowledge as possible to the management.\n\nvi. The Directors should bestow attention on the following aspects of the bank's working:\n\nvii. The directors should not involve themselves in any matter relating to personnel administration such as appointment, transfer, posting or promotion, or redressal of individual grievances of any employee. They should not do anything which will interfere with and/or be subversive of maintenance of discipline, good conduct and integrity of the staff.\n\nviii. The directors should not approach or exert influence for sanction of any kind of facility by the bank. They should also not sponsor any loan proposal, buildings or sites for bank's premises, enlistment or empanelment of contractors, architects, doctors, lawyers, etc. At the same time, they should not be prejudiced against individual proposals.\n\nix. The directors should not participate in the Board discussion if a proposal in which they are directly or indirectly interested comes up for discussion. They should disclose their interest well in advance to the MD/CEO and the Board.\n\nx. The directors may indicate their directorship of the bank on their visiting card or letter head, but the logos or distinctive design of the bank should not be displayed on the visiting card / letter head."

The Government of India has decided that the date of closure of residual transactions for the month of March 2024 be fixed as April 10, 2024. In view of the ensuing closing of Government accounts for the financial year 2023-24, receiving branches including those not situated locally, should adopt special arrangements such as courier service etc., for passing on challans/scrolls etc., to the Nodal/Focal Point branches so that all payments and collections made on behalf of Government towards the end of March are accounted for in the same financial year. These instructions regarding special messenger arrangements may please be informed to all branches concerned.\n\n3. As regards reporting of March 2024 transactions by Nodal/Focal Point branches in April 2024, the branches may be advised to follow the procedure as outlined in the Annex. To sum up, the nodal/Focal Point branches will be required to prepare separate set of scrolls, one pertaining to March 2024 residual transactions and another for April transactions during the first 10 days of April 2024. The Nodal/Focal Point branches should also ensure that the accounts for all transactions (revenues/tax collections/payments) are effected at the receiving branches up to March 31, 2024 in the accounts for the current financial year itself and are not mixed up with the transactions of April 2024. Also, while reporting transactions pertaining to March 2024 up to April 10, 2024, the transactions of April 2024 should not be mixed up with the residual transactions relating to March 2024.\n\n4.

The main scrolls for March 2024 transactions prepared from April 1 to April 10, 2024 are to be distinctly marked as March Residual – 1, March Residual – 2 and so on upto April 10, 2024. In other words, serial number should be allotted in consecutive order for each main scroll of March 2024 transactions sent from April 1 to April 10, 2024. These scrolls along with the copies of daily summary of Receipts and Payments prepared separately for March 2024 transactions will be forwarded to the Departmental Officials concerned (i.e. Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers and Designated Officers) in the usual way. The Nodal/Focal Point branches will also be required to report the above transactions to the Link Cell through separate Daily Memos. These advices must be sent to enable the Link Cell of each bank, to make daily settlement with Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section (CAS) Nagpur. On receipt of advices from the Nodal/Focal Point branches, the Link Cell should segregate the advices for the March Residual transactions and forward them separately to Reserve Bank of India, CAS, Nagpur. This procedure should continue upto and inclusive of April 10, 2024 only. All transactions reported thereafter by the receiving branches will be reported and accounted for in the usual manner in the accounts of the month of report irrespective of the date of transaction. Following the special arrangements for March 2024 transactions, it is necessary for the Nodal/Focal Point branches to prepare two sets of DMS to be submitted to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers for March 2024 transactions – one for transactions upto March 31, 2024 and another for March Residual transactions adjusted by Nodal/Focal Point branches with Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur, during April 1 to April 10, 2024.\n\n3. Since the Nodal/Focal Point branch will also be reporting the April 2024 transactions pertaining to year 2024-25 in addition to March 2024 residual transactions, monthly statement for April 2024 transactions should be compiled and furnished to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers in the usual way. In order to distinguish the April 2024 (financial year 2024-25) and March Residual Transactions, the statement pertaining to March Residual Transactions should be clearly marked as ';March Residual Account';. The statement of March (Residual) Transactions should be sent by all Focal Point Branches to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers latest by April 18, 2024.\n\nNote: As advised in our Circular GA.NB.No.376/42.01.001/1995-96 dated May 22, 1996 all the cheques/amounts realized on or before March 31, 2024 should be treated as transactions relating to the current financial year as ';March 2024 or March Residual Transactions';, the reporting of which may take place during the month of April (upto April 10, 2024). But if any cheque is tendered on or before March 31, 2024 and realised on or after April 1, 2024, it will be treated as transaction for the next financial year as ';April Transactions';. Accordingly, the banks will prepare separate scrolls for March 2024 and April 2024 (Financial year 2024-25) transactions."

As you are aware, the Master Direction - Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks (Directions), 2023 dated September 12, 2023 (hereinafter referred as ‘MD on Investment’) inter alia provides a clearly identifiable trading book under ‘Held for Trading (HFT)’ accounting sub-classification and introduces AFS-reserve which would be part of regulatory capital. In view of the changes cited above, it has been decided to amend the capital adequacy guidelines in alignment with the MD on Investment.\n\n3. Accordingly, the provisions of Master Circular – Basel III Capital Regulations have been modified as provided in Annex 1.\n\n4. It may be noted that ‘Draft Guidelines on Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk – under Basel III’ providing inter alia ‘Definition of trading book’ and ‘Market Risk capital Requirements – Simplified Standardised Approach’ were released on February 17, 2023 for public comments. While the revised definition of trading book for the purpose of capital adequacy will be as provided in Annex I of MD on Investment, the final guidelines on ‘Market Risk Capital Requirements – Simplified Standardised Approach’ will be implemented at a later date and detailed guidelines will be issued separately.\n\n5. Considering the transition to ‘Market Risk Capital Requirements – Simplified Standardised Approach’, the extant market risk capital requirements have also been recalibrated by introducing intermediate scalers. Banks should keep this in view while reviewing their strategies and capital planning measures.\n\n6. Further, the provisions of Master Direction – Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy for Local Area Banks (Directions), 2021 have been modified as provided in Annex 2."

It is seen that SEs have adopted varying levels of automation to support this function, ranging from use of macro-enabled spreadsheets to workflow-based software solutions. The review brought out that automation of the compliance monitoring process in SEs remains a work in progress with various aspects of this function being carried out with significant manual intervention. There is, thus, a need to implement comprehensive, integrated, enterprise-wide and workflow-based solutions/ tools to enhance the effectiveness of this function.\n\n2. Such a solution/ tool should, among other things, provide for effective communication and collaboration among all the stakeholders (by bringing business, compliance and IT teams, Senior Management, etc. on one platform); have processes for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing compliance requirements; escalate issues of non-compliance, if any; require recording approval of competent authority for deviations/ delay in compliance submission; and have a unified dashboard view to Senior Management on compliance position of the Regulated Entity (RE) as a whole. The RE, based on the size and complexity of its operations, may decide on the tools/ mechanism it would prefer to deploy for monitoring of compliance and development of the unified dashboard.\n\n3. Accordingly, REs are advised to carry out a comprehensive review of the existing internal compliance tracking and monitoring processes and institute necessary changes to existing systems or implement new systems latest by June 30, 2024.\n\n4. An appropriate monitoring mechanism may also be put in place to review the progress of its implementation.\n\n5. Please acknowledge receipt.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(T K Rajan)    Chief General Manager"

However, where the existing exposure comprises only term loans and non-fund-based facilities, while no further exposure shall be taken on such borrowers, these facilities may be allowed to continue as per their respective repayment schedule / till maturity.\n\n3.1.3 Whether borrowers / parties belong to a ‘group of connected borrowers / parties’ shall be determined based on the instructions contained at Para 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 above.\n\n3.2 Computation of exposure ceiling for individual / group borrowers\n\nThe exercise of computing the exposure ceilings may be conducted every year after the finalisation and audit of balance sheet of the bank and the exposure ceilings may be advised to the loan sanctioning authorities and the investment department in the bank. In view of the linking of shareholding to lending, accretion to or reduction in the share capital after the balance sheet date, may be taken into account for determining exposure ceiling at half-yearly intervals, with the approval of their Board of Directors. Accordingly, banks may, if they so desire, fix a fresh exposure limit taking into account the amount of share capital available as on 30th September. However, accretion to capital funds other than to share capital, such as half-yearly profit etc., will not be eligible for reckoning the exposure ceiling. Banks should also ensure that they do not take exposures in excess of ceiling prescribed in anticipation of infusion of capital on a future date.\n\n3.3 Thresholds for value of loans\n\nUCBs shall have at least 50 per cent of their aggregate loans and advances comprising loans of not more than ₹25 lakh or 0.2 per cent of their Tier-I capital, whichever is higher, subject to a maximum of ₹1 crore, per borrower / party. Tier-I capital for this purpose shall be reckoned in the manner provided in paragraph 2.1 above. Notwithstanding the above, UCBs shall adhere to the exposure limits stipulated at Para 3.1 above. UCBs which do not, at present, comply with the prescribed threshold shall be in conformity with the above requirements by March 31, 2024. It is clarified that ‘loans’ for the purpose shall include all types of funded and non-funded exposures in the nature of credit.\n\n3.4 Exposure to Housing, Real Estate and Commercial Real Estate\n\n3.4.1 UCBs are advised to frame, with the approval of their Board of Directors, comprehensive prudential norms relating to the ceiling on the total amount of real estate loans, keeping in view the Reserve Bank of India guidelines to ensure that bank credit is used for construction activity and not for activity connected with speculation in real estate subject to the instructions in following paragraphs.\n\n3.4.2 The exposure of UCBs to housing (including individual loans for house repairs, additions and alteration), real estate and commercial real estate loans (including Commercial Real Estate –Residential Housing) would be limited to 10 per cent of their total assets. The above ceiling of 10 per cent of total assets can be exceeded by an additional limit of 5 per cent of total assets for the purpose of grant of housing loans to individuals as per the eligibility limits for priority sector classification, as contained in Master Direction FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.5/04.09.01/2020-21 dated September 04, 2020, amended from time to time.\n\n3.4.3 The total assets may be reckoned based on the audited balance sheet as on March 31 of the preceding financial year. For reckoning total assets, losses, intangible assets, contra items like bills receivables etc. would be excluded.\n\n3.4.4 Working capital loans given by UCBs against hypothecation of construction materials provided to the contractors who undertake comparatively small construction on their own without receiving advance payments is exempted from the prescribed limit.\n\n3.4.5 UCBs are not permitted to exceed the limit prescribed for grant of housing, real estate, commercial real estate loans to the extent of funds obtained from higher financing agencies and refinance from National Housing Bank.\n\n3.4.6 Tier-11 UCBs are permitted to extend individual housing loans upto a maximum of ₹60 lakh per individual borrower and UCBs categorised in Tier-2 to 4 can extend individual housing loans up to a maximum of ₹140 lakh per individual borrower subject to extant prudential exposure limits.\n\n3.5 Inter-bank Exposure Limit\n\n3.5.1 Prudential Inter-bank (Gross) Exposure Limit\n\nUCBs shall be guided by provisions contained at Para 14.1 (a) of chapter VIII of the Master Direction on ‘Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of UCBs’ dated April 1, 2023, as updated from time to time.\n\n3.5.2 Prudential Inter-bank Counterparty Limit\n\nUCBs shall be guided by provisions contained at Para 14.1 (b) of chapter VIII of the Master Direction on ‘Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of UCBs’ dated April 1, 2023, as updated from time to time.\n\n3.6 Placement / acceptance of Deposits\n\nPlacement / acceptance of deposits by UCBs shall be subject to instructions contained under Chapter VIII of Master Direction on Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of UCBs dated April 1, 2023, as amended from time to time."

Further, the directors or their relatives or the firms / companies / concerns in which the directors or their relatives are interested shall also not stand as surety / guarantor to the loans and advances or any other financial accommodation sanctioned by UCBs. ‘Advances’ for the purpose shall include all types of funded / working capital limits such as cash credits, overdrafts, credit cards, etc.\n\n6.1.2 The following categories of Director related loans are exempted from the purview of the above instructions:\n\n6.1.3 Explanation: For the purpose of these directions –\n\n(i) The term 'any other financial accommodation' shall include funded and non-funded credit limits and underwritings and similar commitments, as under:\n\n(ii) The word “relative” shall have the meaning as under:\n\nA person shall be deemed to be a relative of another, if and only if:-\n\n(iii) The word “interested” shall mean the director of the UCB or his relative, as the case may be, being a director, managing agent, manager, employee, proprietor, partner, coparcener or guarantor, as the case may be, of the firm / company / concern [including Hindu Undivided Family (HUF)]:\n\nProvided that a Director of a UCB or his relative shall also be deemed to be interested in a company, being the subsidiary or holding company, if he / she is a Director, Managing Agent, Manager, employee or guarantor of the respective holding or subsidiary company:\n\nProvided further that a director of a UCB shall also be deemed to be interested in a company / firm if he / she holds substantial interest in or is in control of the company / firm or in a company, being the subsidiary or holding company, if he / she holds substantial interest in or is in control of the respective holding or subsidiary company:\n\nProvided further that a relative of a director of a UCB shall also be deemed to be interested in a company / firm if he / she is a major shareholder or is in control of the company / firm or in a company, being the subsidiary or holding company, if he / she is a major shareholder or is in control of the respective holding or subsidiary company.\n\n(iv) The term “substantial interest” shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in section 5(ne) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n\n(v) The term “control” shall include the right to appoint majority of the directors or to control the management or policy decisions exercisable by a person or persons acting individually or in concert, directly or indirectly, including by virtue of their shareholding or management rights or shareholders agreements or voting agreements or in another manner.\n\n(vi) The term “major shareholder” shall mean a person holding 10 per cent or more of the paid up share capital.\n\n6.1.4 UCBs shall submit information pertaining to their Director-related loans as at the end of each quarter (i.e. 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December), in the format given in the Annex-1, to the concerned Regional Office of Department of Supervision of Reserve Bank of India within fifteen days from the end of the respective quarter.

This would include issue of guarantees on their behalf.\n\n6.6.2 Advances against units of mutual funds can be extended only to individuals as in the case of advances against the security of shares, debentures and bonds (Para 6.6.3).\n\n6.6.3 Loans against the primary / collateral security of shares / debentures should be limited to ₹ 5 lakh if the security is in physical form and up to ₹ 10 lakh if the security is in demat form.\n\n6.6.4 A margin of 50 per cent should be maintained on all such advances.\n\n6.6.5 Aggregate of all loans against the security of shares and debentures should be within the overall ceiling of 20 percent of the owned funds of the bank.\n\n6.6.6 UCBs are required to report to the respective Regional Offices of the Reserve Bank of India their outstanding, to individual borrowers and other entities against shares on quarterly basis in the format given in Annex 2.\n\n6.6.7 It is essential that before accepting shares as security, banks should put in place appropriate risk management systems. All the approved loan proposals should be placed before the Audit Committee of the Bank at least once in two months. The Management and Audit Committee should ensure that all loans against shares are made only to those individuals who are not in any way connected with any stock broking entity. Details of the loan sanctioned should be reported to the Board in its subsequent meeting.\n\n6.7 Bank Finance against Preference Shares and Long Term (Subordinated) Bonds\n\nUCBs shall not grant any loan or advance to any person for purchasing their own Perpetual Non Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS), Tier-II preference shares (such as Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares, Redeemable Non Cumulative Preference Shares and Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares), Perpetual Debt instruments (PDI) and Long Term Subordinated bonds (LTSB). UCBs shall not grant any loan or advance to any person for purchasing PNCPS, Tier-II preference shares, PDI and LTSB of other banks. UCBs should not invest in PNCPS (Tier-I), other Preference shares (Tier-II) and also in Long Term (Subordinated) Deposits (Tier-II), PDI, LTSB issued by other banks; nor should they grant advances against the security of the above instruments issued by them or other banks.\n\n6.8 Bank Finance to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)\n\n6.8.1 Admission of NBFCs as Members\n\n(i) For availing loans or advances from a UCB, its membership is a must. However, UCBs are normally not expected to enroll non-banking financial institutions (like investment and financial companies as well as other persons engaged in the business competing with or conflicting with the business of the bank) as their members since it would be in contravention of the state co-operative societies act concerned and will also not be in conformity with the provision of model by-law No. 9. Therefore, banks should not finance NBFCs, other than those engaged in hire-purchase / leasing.\n\n(ii) Similarly, admission of non-banking financial companies which are not engaged exclusively in leasing / hire purchase business as members may be contrary to the provisions contained in the state cooperative societies act concerned and model by-law No. 9. It will, therefore, be necessary for the UCBs to obtain prior approval of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies concerned before admitting such leasing / hire purchase companies as members.\n\n6.8.2 Activities eligible for finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities\n\nWithin the prescribed credit exposure norms and above stated restrictions, UCBs, with working capital funds aggregating to ₹25 crores and above, may finance the NBFC - Investment and Credit Companies (NBFC-ICC), subject to the following limits:\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\nNote\n\n(i) The maximum limit on bank finance should be within the overall ceiling of borrowing by NBFCs, upto ten times of their NOF.\n\n(ii) Bank finance to leasing concerns should be restricted only to ';full payout'; leases i.e., those leases where the cost of the asset is fully recovered during the primary lease period itself and further it should cover purchases of only new equipment.\n\n(iii) As a prudent policy, lease rentals due during the period of next five years should alone be taken into account for the purpose of lending.\n\n6.8.3 Activities not Eligible for Finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities\n\n6.8.3.1 The following activities undertaken by non-banking financial companies engaged in hire purchase / leasing activities are not eligible for bank credit. As such, these items should be excluded from the build-up of current assets while arriving at permissible bank finance for all categories of NBFCs :\n\n6.8.3.2 In respect of items indicated at (a) and (b) above, banks should not make any adjustment in the projected net working capital (NWC). It may be added that the projected NWC represents long-term surplus available to support current operations and, therefore, does not need to be adjusted as a result of changing / pruning the level of current assets while reducing the level of maximum permissible bank finance.\n\n6.8.4 Financing of NBFCs by Scheduled UCBs\n\n6.8.4.1 Scheduled UCBs may rediscount bills discounted by NBFCs arising from sale of commercial vehicles, including light commercial vehicles, two wheeler and three wheeler vehicles, subject to normal lending safeguards and the following conditions:\n\n6.8.4.2 Scheduled UCBs may provide finance to NBFCs eligible for bank finance for the purpose of on lending to Small Road and Water Transport Operators (SRWTOs) for purchase of trucks and classify such advances under priority sector, provided the ultimate borrowers (SRWTOs) satisfy the eligibility requirements for being classified under the priority sector.\n\n6.8.4.3 UCBs may finance NBFCs for on-lending to individual farmers and for hire purchase schemes for distribution of agricultural machinery and implements and the same may be reckoned for the purpose of priority sector lending as indirect finance to agriculture.\n\n6.8.4.4 The Scheduled UCBs may extend finance to NBFCs or other financial intermediaries for on-lending to small and micro enterprises (manufacturing as well as service) and classify such finance under priority sector after satisfying that relevant norms at the ultimate borrowal level are complied with.\n\n6.9 Financing Equipment Leasing and Hire Purchase Financing\n\nConsequent to the Government of India notification dated December 12, 1995 specifying 'Hire Purchase' and 'Equipment Leasing' as forms of business in which it is lawful for a primary cooperative bank to engage, Scheduled UCBs are allowed to undertake these activities. Scheduled UCBs are advised to ensure that:\n\nNon Scheduled UCBs, which also desire to undertake these activities should obtain RBI permission.\n\n6.10 Financing for Agricultural Activities\n\nUCBs are permitted to finance agricultural activities under priority sector subject to the following conditions:\n\n6.11 Loans to Self Help Groups (SHGs) / Joint Liability Groups (JLGs)\n\n6.11.1 UCBs may lend to SHGs and JLGs as per their Board approved policy framed according to the prescribed RBI guidelines in this regard.\n\n6.11.2 UCBs may follow the method of lending directly to SHGs / JLGs. Lending through intermediaries will not be permitted.\n\n6.11.3 The extant limits (individual and total) on grant of unsecured loans and advances will not apply to loans granted to SHGs. However, loans granted by UCBs to JLGs, to the extent not backed by tangible security, will be treated as unsecured and will be subject to the extant limits on unsecured loans and advances.\n\n6.11.4 Loans granted to SHGs / JLGs would be governed by the extant guidelines on individual exposure limits.\n\n6.11.5 The maximum amount of loan to SHGs should not exceed four times of the savings of the group. The limit may be exceeded in case of well managed SHGs subject to a ceiling of ten times of savings of the group. The groups may be rated on the basis of certain objective parameters such as proven track record, savings pattern, recovery rate, housekeeping etc. JLGs are not obliged to keep deposits with the bank and hence the amount of loan granted to JLGs would be based on the credit needs of the JLG and the bank's assessment of the credit requirement.\n\n6.12 Restriction on Advances to Defaulters of Statutory Dues\n\n6.12.1 Under the law, employees' contributions to provident fund deducted from wages of the employees / members, for a period of more than six months and not paid to the Commissioner are a first charge on the assets of the borrowers, in the case of the insolvency / winding up of the borrowing employer. In the circumstances, primary (urban) cooperative banks should safeguard their interest vis-à-vis such statutory dues.\n\n6.12.2 Therefore, banks should satisfy themselves that there are no arrears of Provident Fund and other statutory dues of the borrowers by obtaining a declaration from them that all such dues have been duly paid. Proof in this regard may be called for only in cases where banks have reason to doubt the borrowers' declaration. Even where a proof is required, it is not necessary to insist on a certificate from the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner; production of a receipt evidencing the payment of the dues or a certificate from the auditors of the borrower or any other similar proof may be considered sufficient. In the case of sick units where there are arrears for reasons beyond the control of the borrowers, banks may continue to consider such cases on merits."

Consequently, the sub-clause (xvii) of clause (a) of Section 3 of the above quoted Master Direction has been removed.

In cases where there is no explicit mandate to renew the term deposit, the banks should review such accounts if the customers have not withdrawn the proceeds after maturity or transferred these to their savings/current account in order to prevent such deposits from becoming unclaimed. The banks shall inform the account/deposit holders in writing through letters or email or SMS (if the email and mobile number are registered with the bank) that there has been no operation in their accounts/deposits in the last one year, as the case may be. The alert messages shall invariably mention that the account would become ‘inoperative’ if no operations are carried out during the next one year and, the account holder would be required to submit KYC documents afresh for reactivating the account in such case.\n\n2.2 If the letters are returned undelivered or no response is received through registered email, the bank shall immediately undertake an enquiry to find out the whereabouts of account holder or his/her nominee/legal heirs in case the account holder is deceased.\n\n2.3. In case any response is received from the account holder giving the reasons for not operating the account, the banks shall continue to classify the account as operative for one more year and the account holder shall be advised to operate the account within a period of one year (herein after referred to as ‘extended period’). In case the account holder still fails to operate the account within the extended period, the banks shall classify the said account as inoperative account after the expiry of the extended period.\n\n2.4 For the purpose of classifying an account as ‘inoperative’, only customer induced transactions and not bank induced transactions shall be considered. There may be instances where the customer has given a mandate like Standing Instructions (SI)/ auto-renewal instructions and there are no other operations in the Savings /Current account or the Term Deposit. These transactions shall also be treated as customer induced transactions.\n\n2.5 The classification of an account as inoperative shall be for a particular account of the customer and not with reference to the customer. In case a customer is maintaining multiple accounts/deposits with a bank, all such accounts/deposits shall be assessed individually for the purpose of classifying them as inoperative account/ unclaimed deposit, as the case may be.\n\n2.6 In case the account holder is not carrying out transaction and the account is - inoperative due to shifting of primary account to another bank, the account holder may be requested to provide the details of the new bank account with authorisation to enable the bank to transfer the balance from the existing bank account."
